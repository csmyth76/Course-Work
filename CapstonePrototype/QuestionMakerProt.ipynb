      " Cognition is \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses\". == Etymology ==\n",
      "The word cognition comes from the Latin verb cognosco (con, 'with', and gnōscō, 'know'; itself a cognate of the Greek verb γι(γ)νώσκω, gi(g)nόsko, meaning 'I know, perceive'), meaning 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'. == The beginnings of the studies on cognition ==\n",
      "The word cognition dates back to the 15th century, when it meant \"thinking and awareness\". Attention to cognitive processes came about more than eighteen centuries earlier, however, beginning with Aristotle (384–322 BC) and his interest in the inner workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Two millennia later, as psychology emerged as a burgeoning field of study in Europe and then gained a following in America, other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition. Though Wundt's contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be quite subjective and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentation to make conclusions about the human cognitive process. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook Principles of Psychology that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention. == In psychology ==\n",
      "\n",
      "In psychology, the term \"cognition\" is usually used within an information processing view of an individual's psychological functions (see cognitivism), and it is the same in cognitive engineering; in a branch of social psychology called social cognition, the term is used to explain attitudes, attribution, and group dynamics.Human cognition is conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language). It encompasses processes such as memory, association, concept formation, pattern recognition, language, attention, perception, action, problem solving and mental imagery. Traditionally, emotion was not thought of as a cognitive process, but now much research is being undertaken to examine the cognitive psychology of emotion; research is also focused on one's awareness of one's own strategies and methods of cognition, which is called metacognition. While few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the brain, a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or to biological processes (compare neurocognitive). Relatively recent fields of study such as the neuropsychology aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (see also cognitive neuroscience), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (see also artificial intelligence). === Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===\n",
      "For years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on cognitive development or the construction of human thought or mental processes. === Common experiments on human cognition ===\n",
      "Serial position\n",
      "The serial position experiment is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information in the beginning of the sequence, called the primacy effect, and information in the end of the sequence, called the recency effect. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.Word superiority\n",
      "The word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.Brown-Peterson\n",
      "In the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.Memory span\n",
      "During the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.Visual search\n",
      "In one version of the visual search experiment, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.Knowledge representation\n",
      "The semantic network of knowledge representation systems has been studied in various paradigms. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with neural network experiments based on computational systems such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), Bayesian analysis, and multidimensional factor analysis. == Metacognition ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Metacognition is \"cognition about cognition\", \"thinking about thinking\", \"knowing about knowing\", becoming \"aware of one's awareness\" and higher-order thinking skills. There are generally two components of metacognition: (1) knowledge about cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.Metamemory, defined as knowing about memory and mnemonic strategies, is an especially important form of metacognition. Academic research on metacognitive processing across cultures is in the early stages, but there are indications that further work may provide better outcomes in cross-cultural learning between teachers and students.Some evolutionary psychologists hypothesize that humans use metacognition as a survival tool, which would make metacognition the same across cultures. == See also ==\n",

    "# Importing the text the lazy way.\n",
    "gatsby=\"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. \\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\\" he told me, \\\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\\" He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \\\"creative temperament\\\"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\"\n",

K.\\n\\nThe papers presented in this edition of the\\nNewsletter ue examples of a resurgence of interest\\nin how to conceptualize memory and directly\\nexmine the activity of remembering from a collec-\\ntive perspective. A key motivation for adopting\\nsuch a perspective is to inform our understanding\\nof the relationship between tultnre and mind.\\n\\nThe idea for this issue grew from one of a\\nseries of lively and engaging day long colloquiu\\nhosted at LCHC during 1986, The one organized\\non Collective Memory brought together and gen-\\nerated considerable interest in people representing\\nl. wide variety of discipline backgrounds and\\nresearch interests in social sciences and humanities.\\nThe pupae and discussion demonstrated the\\nintegrative potential Across a broad parish of\\ninterest focusing all memory and remembering us\\nI socially constituted activity. The papers in this\\nissue Are made up of some of the discussions origi-\\nnally prepared for the colloquium and additional\\ncontributions that aim to extend the debate. The\\nhope is that readers will be able to share some of\\nthe enthusiasm and interest this topic engendered\\nend that dehlte and criticism will be stimulated\\nfor inclusion in future editions of the Newsletter.\\n\\nThere is a long history of discussion concern-\\ning the notion of collective memory A: a concept\\nit his had a \"bad press\" within both the sociologi-\\neel and psychological literature when conceived as\\nsome process operating at the level of \"gmup/cons-\\nciousnees,\" u if social groups have a farm of \"men-\\ntal life\" that extends beyond that of their consti-\\ntuent members (see for example Farr, 1987), The\\nconcern of these papers is to adopt a wcietnl Ind\\ncollective perspective on how the pest impinges\\nand emerges in present activity without necessarily\\ninvoking critiques associated with the concept of\\neither a \"supra. or super individual mentality.\" A\\nrecurrent theme in all the paper: is that such a res\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntoration can best be Mhieved through a direct eon-\\nsideratioh of the mullet Ind mean: of what medi-\\n\\nate: the link between individuals and their socio-\\ncultural heritage, The focus on the mediationll\\nmeans is crucial if we Me to successquy extend the\\nanalysis beyond the view that it is just I matter of\\nadding context to the study of individual mental-\\nity. Acknowledging that information and\\nknowledge can also be located in the world beyond\\nthe individual, be that a physical or social environ-\\nment, certainly shifts the balance of the analysis\\naway from n \"single minded\" and \"egocentric\"\\neognitivism but it begs the question of just what\\nmediates the relationship between the two.\\n\\nConsideration of the notion of collective\\nmemory and the activity of collective remembering\\nprovides a link between culture and mind in the\\nfollowing sense. The properties of a culture, embo-\\ndied in its artifacts, tools, social customs and insti-\\ntutions, language and terms of reference, provide n\\nhistarical dimension to everyday living that\\nenables knowledge of what has already happened\\nor been achieved to he used in the service of\\npresent and future activity. Our modes of being\\nand doing are cultural products that constitute I\\nguiding construint concerning what form our\\npresent and future actions should or could take.\\n\\nThe papers, therefore, present a social\\napproach to the study of mnemonic activity. How-\\never they go beyond discussing the social dimen-\\nsion as an independent vuiuble in\\xef\\xac\\x82uencing the\\n\"facilitation\" of individual processes, or of contex-\\ntual \"aitnetion\" as represented in ugnments ior ul\\necological approach to cognitione They Are con-\\ncerned with the social \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstitution\" of mnemonic\\nactivity where the individual and social dimension:\\ninhere in one anothert Such a \"constitutive\"\\napproach draws off a rich heritage of work which\\nhe: lAtterly found increasing expression in the\\npresentation of Vygotsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discussions of the rela-\\ntionehip between culture and mind. The themes of\\nthe paper: of this issue can be summarized in rela-\\ntion to Vygotsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas. They re\\xef\\xac\\x82ect a concern to\\nincorporate three major Aspects of human antivity:\\nthe culturul\\xe2\\x80\\x94through n consideration of the\\nmnemonic potentill of tools and Artifacts; the\\nhistoricnl\\xe2\\x80\\x94-in discussions concerning the le\\nlunguuge u I system of signs embodies and makes\\nIvnilehle for contemporary Ilse aspects of previ-\\nously generated cultural knowledge; and the\\nineLrumentaL-in that remembering as a social\\nactivity cannot be the direct retrieval of past\\n\\n2 n: Qurlerly \\xe2\\x80\\x9dmm\" 0/ u: mem .1 Cmyuuiu H-m- cmum Jmuu\\'y 1937, Volume 9, Number 1\\n\\nexperience and knowledge, it is medieted via eul-\\nturquy invented tool: and artifacts.\\n\\nMichael Schudsoii\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paper is a warning\\nagainst the resistance within contemporu\\'y sociol-\\nogy to acknowledge the cultural and historical\\nembeddedness of individual, organizational and\\nnational experiences of daily life and eventst His\\nprimary concern is to introduce a. sense of history\\ninto the sociological process. He argues that the\\nconcept of collective memory afford: this in the\\nway it embodies a consideration of the limits to\\nwhich we are free to reinterpret and tamper with\\nthe past ueording to present expediency and\\ninterest. It introduces dimensions of social time\\nand generation into the reseuch agenda allowing\\nan examination of how the put imposes on the\\npresent without ndvoceting a new version of his-\\ntoricnl determinism. An important pm of the\\nargument is that I consideration of the historical\\ndimension opens up the possibility of deducing\\ngeneral principles from lucll circumstances. The\\nhistorical dimension is re\\xef\\xac\\x82ected in the processes of\\nsocial and individual eveluation that sustain over\\ntime an orientation to cultural products, rather\\nthan reducing social theory to a set of local\\ncmem. [This in e line of ugument reminiscent of\\nthe theory underpinning the work reported in the\\n\"Cognitive Studies of Work\" edition of the\\nNewsletter edited by Sylvia Scribner, [1984) In\\nthat issue e key concern was to deduce general\\nprinciples of cognition from speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c functional ayi\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntems of work activity). The past is not just the\\nubitruy plaything of preeent self interest, there is\\na constraint placed on us, it is preserved (sic), by\\nthe very meme we choose to represent and muni-\\nfest what we deem as signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant from the paste\\nThat balance between choice and constraint or\\nbias is teken up in a variety of ways in the papers\\nby Shatter and by Wertseh.\\n\\nJohn Shatter approacha the issue of memory\\nfrom the perspective of a psychologist critical of\\nthe prevailing metaphors that underpin the\\npsychological study of individual memory, mete\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nphors that frequently assume the non-pmhlemetic\\nstatus of mental processes and structure inside\\npeople\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heads. He ground: and illultnteu his die-\\ncuseion in the work of Wittgenstein and Bartlett,\\namong others, both of whom urged that memory\\ncannot adequately be conceptualized u a property\\nof individuals. Thut is, memory is not studieble in\\n\\nits own right, without reference to the forms of\\nsocial activity that generate the functionel require-\\nments of how we deal with the past, a past with\\n\"content\" and \"motive\" forged in the eir-\\ncumetmcea of everyday culture] existence One of\\nthe main features of Shotter\\xe2\\x80\\x99e argument is that we\\ncannot remember on our own because we have no\\nreel way of checking the status of the remembering\\nwith the original events. Such a checking out can\\nonly come if we take remembering and forgetting\\nas activities involving content that ix vulidnted\\nAccording to criteria derived from the culture in\\nwhich we live. What allows the individual to\\ninternalize those social and cultural constraints,\\nthat act as a form of collective memory, are the\\nfarms of talk that we can legitimately employ to\\naccount for our activity. Those ucounting prac-\\ntiees do not just serve to represent our pest experi-\\nenee they elm \"work to reproduce the social order\\nof which we are members.\" The modes and\\nmotives for ucounting for mu- ectiona in the way\\nwe do and the way they constitute the activity of\\nremembering are taken up in Wertuh\\xe2\\x80\\x99e discussion.\\nThey elm ling one of the main futures of the\\npapers by Middleton and by Edwards in that they\\nare concerned with looking directly at the farms of\\ntalk as the medium in which remembering collec-\\ntively is realized.\\n\\nJames Wertech takes up the discussion of\\ncollective memory as a means of extending Ind\\nreconciling competing views within the \"eociohis\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntoxical\" perspective on mental development that\\nhave recently surfaced in western commentaries\\nAnd the literature available in English. He\\nemphasizes that the collective dimension in mental\\nfunctioning is more than some distribution of the\\ncognitive burden in coordinated joint activity.\\nMental functions are collective in that the meme\\nby which they are mediated have a cultural his\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntory\\xe2\\x80\\x98 He takes up the discussion of medietionnl\\nmeans as a way of extending his discussion of the\\nVygotskian analysis beyond the immediacy of\\ninterpersonal activity.

It\\ntherefore provides a powerful means of sharing the\\nmnemonic burden and distributing the resulting\\nconsensus of what may or may not have happened\\nand what should or should or should not he done\\nin the light of past experience. All the contribu\\xc2\\xbb\\ntions are concerned with looking at rather than\\nthrough discourse. Conversational discourse is\\ntherefore approached not as a window onto indivi-\\ndual mentality, but as a medium through which\\nwe coordinate culturally bounded and constituted\\nmentalities,\\n\\nDavid Middleton analyzes the role of joint or\\ncollective remembering in recreating a folk dance\\ntradition. English Morris Dancing is the tradition\\ndiscussed. One of the many ways in which this live\\ntradition is continually recreated is explored\\nthrough an analysis of how a team of dancers\\nworks out a problematic sequence during one of\\ntheir regular rehearnls. A sequence of dialogue\\nrecorded when the dance had fallen into complete\\ndisarray reveals three important elements for coor-\\ndinating end mediating their collective expertise\\nand memory in the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of a viable versjou of\\nthe dance in question. First the importance of\\nachieving a consensus of meaning for the vocabu\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nlary of terms used to describe the patterns of\\nmoves in the dantes. Second, how that vocabulary\\nis constructed and eonventiondized during argu-\\nments that draw of a variety of mnemonic\\nresources availahle to and represented by the team\\nmembers. Third, how a division of mnemonic\\nlabour within the team distributes the mnemonic\\nburden in euch a way that no one member need\\nknow exactly how each and every aspect of the\\n\\ndance should or should not he executed. All three\\nelements of history, culture and instrumentality\\nplay their part in the team\\xe2\\x80\\x98s efforts to resolve their\\ndilemma.\\n\\nDerek Edwards examines how a concept of\\ncollective remembering provides a means of inter-\\npreting the conversational discourse of the class-\\nroornv At the level of daily educational practice it\\nprovides a way of understanding how any domain\\nof educational activity is contextualiled in mutual\\nor common knowledge that is established in con-\\ntinuities mediated by conversational discourse At\\nthe level of educational theory it also alfonls the\\npossibility of reconciling two competing ideologies\\nof educational practice, one that sees education as\\ntransmission of knowledge, and one that sees it as\\ncreating the environment far children to discover\\nand construct their own understanding The con-\\ncept of collective remembering provides a way of\\napproaching the immediacy and joint construction\\nof understanding in classroom activity while at the\\nsame time incorporating the fact that my curricu-\\nlum is a cultural artifact with a history that the\\nchildren could not discover independent of the\\nagency of the teacher,\\n\\nFinally Margie WaIler\\xe2\\x80\\x99e contribution pro-\\nvides a \\xef\\xac\\x81tting tail piece to this issue.

The unique feature of\\nthis \\xef\\xac\\x81lm was that the sound track was made up of\\nthe family\\xe2\\x80\\x98s collective comments and recall on\\nviewing the originally ailent footage.

As it happens, \"collec~\\ntive memory\" is not a concept often used in sociol-\\nogy. It is assimilated to a general line of French\\nsociai thought traced to Emile Durkheim that\\nemphasise: the reality of \"social facts\" existing\\nindependently of individuals. The term tends to\\nbe placed in inverted commas to indicate that it\\nshould be regarded skeptically. Sociologists,\\nAmerican meiologiats at any rate, treat with\\nsuspicion any concept that cannot be speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cally\\nlocated in individuals or in institutions; they take\\nany Concept that points to the discredited idea of a\\n\"group mind\" with a grain of salt.\\n\\nThere is in American sociology and in Ameri\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ncan social sciences more widely a ntionalist and\\nmaterialist inclination reluctant to acknowledge\\nthe power of either culture or tradition. ao \"collec-\\ntive memory\" is in double jeopardy In the study\\nof ideas, ideology, and belief-systems, there is a\\n\\nstrong resurgence of a view that Cli\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'ord Geertz,\\nnearly 25 years ago, belittled as \"interest theory.\"\\nThis is the position that there is nothing more to\\nthe study of ideology than locating the material\\ninterests served by the ideas people adhere to, since\\npeople construct theix beliefs to serve their own\\nreal interests} Interest theorists, among others,\\nhave found that even the put can be reconstructed\\nand rewritten to serve social interests. This is an\\nobservation that arouses special indignation: there\\nis a sense, even among the most critical and\\nworld-weuy Imveilers of the material basis of ideas\\nand ideologies, that \"history\" should somehow he\\ninviolate. Nothing so clearly separates literate\\nfrom nonlitente societies as the di\\xef\\xac\\x82erence between\\nhistory, responsible to an unchanging written\\nrecord, and myth, always suceptible to reworking\\nand limited only by living human memoryi Au\\nMalinowski put it in his famous dictum that myth\\nis a sociological \"charter\" for primitive societies,\\n\"...myth, taken as a whole, cannot be sober,\\ndispusionate history, since it is always made ad\\nhm: to ful\\xef\\xac\\x81ll t certain sociological function, to\\nglorify a certain group, or to justify an anomaloul\\nstatus.\" 2 Few facts about Soviet intellectual life so\\npowerfully a\\xef\\xac\\x82ected American anti-Soviet views in\\nthe 1950: a: the repeated observation that the\\nSoviets rewrote their own (and the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) history\\nto glorify the Soviet state and the communist\\nparty. George Orwell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1964 was widely read\\n(somewhat unfairly) as an attack on the Soviet\\nUnion, and it is not surprising that at its center,\\nthe luckless hero, Winston Smith, should be a\\ncipher in Oceania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ministry of Truth, his job that\\nof erasing from the historical record facts incon-\\nvenient to the present regime. One of the motto:\\nof Oceania. was the now familiar phrase, \"Who\\ncontrols the put controls the future.\"\\n\\nSixty years after Malinowski\\xe2\\x80\\x98s \"charter\" and\\n40 years after Orwell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ministry of Truth, we have\\nall become primitives and all become Soviets in the\\neyes of many scholars who examine how the con-\\ntemporary world keeps track or neglect: it: put.\\nWe have been made aware of how much our own\\nscholarship is shaped by our whim, how much our\\nown constructions of the American past, for\\ninstance, have c|ea.ned it up, ignoring con\\xef\\xac\\x82ict, eon-\\nveniently overlooking the role of anyone not white,\\nmale, Protestant. heterosexual.

The past is in some respects, and under\\nsome conditions, highly resistant to e\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'orts to make\\nit over. It cannot be made over at wil|\\xe2\\x80\\x94-which is\\nnot to say that people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try. People And\\norganizations and nations do make their own\\npasts, to paraphrase Karl Marx, but they do not\\ndo so in conditions of their own choosing, with\\nmaterials of their own making, or even with their\\nmemories acting entirely under their own volition.\\n\\nThe full freedom to reconstruct the put\\nucording to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own present interests is limited\\nby three factors: the structure of available puts,\\nthe structure of individual choices, and the\\ncon\\xef\\xac\\x82icts about the put among a multitude of\\nmutually aware individuals or groups. Let me\\nde\\xef\\xac\\x81ne And illustrate euh of these three points. I\\nwill move with some abandon from individual to\\norganizational to national examples. My interest\\nis not specifically in how professional or textbook\\nhistory gets rewritten but how my individual or\\norganization or nation\\xc2\\xbbstete assimilates its own\\npast experience and what processes limit the abil-\\nity to do so successfully for the sake of legitima-\\ntion.\\n\\nI. The Structure of Available Put:\\n\\nIndividual, groups, organizations, nntions,\\nand societies do not have all possible mnterials\\navailable to them from which to construct I past.\\nFrom the viewpoint of the individual seeking legi-\\ntimutioil from the past, there are just so muly\\nthings to work with; the available materials are far\\nfrom in\\xef\\xac\\x81nite. Of course, within what is evail-ble,\\nthere is much that cut still be dune to bend\\ninterpretation to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will\\xe2\\x80\\x94but the available\\nmateriel: still set limits.

Far from it. There are a\\nvariety of ways in which the freedom to choose is\\nconstrained. I will lump these into four categories:\\n\\ntrauma, vicarious trauma, channel, und commit-\\nment.\\n\\nTrauma. \"It is rather the rule than the\\nexception for the past to be preserved in mental\\nlife,\" Sigmund Freud wrote.13 He memt this quite\\n\\nIiterally\\xe2\\x80\\x94not that the person in the present recon-\\nstructs :- past to \\xef\\xac\\x81t his or her fancy but that some\\nput of the put, like it or not, is lodged in the\\nmind, like A wound that injures And no changes the\\nbody and forces the body to respond to heal itself-\\n\\xc2\\xbbhut never quite the same as it Wu before.\\n\\nTrauma, u I use the term here, are past\\nexperiences people [at organiletione 0r nations)\\ncannot ignore even when they would like to, cui-\\nnot divert their attention from without courting\\nanxiety, fen, and pain. Not only must Americana\\ntonfront slavery, not only must Germans {Me the\\nHolocaust, but they must do so reputedly, obses-\\nsively, necessuily, whether they like it or not. To\\ntake a more humble example, labor lenders of\\nWorcester, Massachusetts in the late 19th century\\nwarned Against precipitious action in labor\\ndisputes by recalling \"failed strikes of 10, 20, or\\neven 45 years past.\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9c This wns not a matter of\\ncaution: men seeking legitimation for their pur-\\nposes but of members of a community who felt, a:\\nifon their own bodies, the gem of the put.\\n\\nThe past become: pm of us, and shapes us,\\nit in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence: our consciousness, whether we like it\\nor not. In the pnthologieal, hut familiar, form,\\npeople become entrapped by their old wounds.\\nThey establish what Jerome Bruner cells a.\\n\"preemptive metaphor,\" \"the technique by which\\nmany seemingly unrelated thing: m tied together\\nby a common fear and a common evoidante.\"15\\nThe neurotic individual governed at too ehuply\\ngoverned by a preemptive metaphor overel\\xef\\xac\\x81ciently\\nanticipate! and avoids anything on the overin-\\nelusive danger list that An euly trauma, or the\\ninability to master the early trauma, has compiled\\nin the mind.\\n\\nVicarious tnuma. People react not only\\nto extreme conditions in their own lives but to\\nextreme conditions in the livee of othen. In\\nCongressional elections. incumbents win in well\\nover 90% of all contested races and usually win by\\noverwhelming margins. There is, for a vu-iety of\\nreasons, m extraordinary incumbent advantage.\\nNevertheless, many incumbents, even in what all\\nobservers would judge to be very \"nfe\" districts,\\nrun expensive re-election campaigns.

It\\nshould be cleu\\' that this includes not only nspects\\nof the past regarded with horror but other aspects\\nreguded with pride. Button Clark has argued\\nthat the key feature that identi\\xef\\xac\\x81es the \"distinc-\\ntive\" small colleges he studied is that they have \"a\\nstrong organintional saga or legend\" capable of\\ncapturing the allegiance and commitment of the\\ncollege stall. [There can be u pathology of pride :5\\nwell as of traumu\\xc2\\xbb-en organizational saga, Clerk\\nwrites, \"turns a.n organintion into a community,\\neven a cult.\"l\"\\n\\nChannels.

A key feature that shapes how u\\ncommunity responds to con\\xef\\xac\\x82ict will be, quite sim-\\nply, how the community has responded to con\\xef\\xac\\x82ict\\nin the past.\\n\\nSince controversy arising out of a par\\nticular kind of crisis is not likely to\\noccur frequently in a community, each\\ncommunity hu little opportunity to\\n\\nevolve, in e number of trials, the\\noptimal procedures for hnndling\\ndisngreements. Qnite m the contrary,\\nthe outcome of one dispute \\xe2\\x80\\x98loads the\\ndice\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in favor of a similar outcome the\\nnext time. Only a few such incidents\\nmay be necessary to \\xef\\xac\\x81x the path of\\ncommunity disputes for \\xef\\xac\\x81fty or one\\nhundred years to come.ls\\n\\nThus even rue events, even unique events, may\\nhave extraordinary in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence on people and organi-\\nzations long after the fut. There is, in particular,\\ngreat power to originating events, the character of\\n\"founding fathers\" or constitutional documents.\\nAs myone who has ever been a member of a com-\\nmittee knows, there is frequently a need for orien-\\ntation, for a starting point to deal with a new\\nproblem or issue, and I search for precedent\\nensues\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\n\\nCommitments.

K\\n\\nl want to discuss A noncognitive, social con-\\nstructionist approach to remembering and forgelr\\nting (Gergen, 1982, 1985; Shatter, 1984). It is an\\napproach in which, not so much luguuge as such,\\nbut speech, our ways of talking become our initial\\n(hut not necessarily our \\xef\\xac\\x81nal) concern. Such\\napprouhes take it that the primary function of all\\nmu talk is not to represent the world; word; da\\nnot primarily stud for things. We maintain that\\nthe primary function of our speech is to co\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nordinate diverse social action; to create, maintain,\\nreproduce and transform certain modes of social\\nand societnl relationships. I! in our experience, it\\nseems undeniable thnt words do in fact denote\\nthings, they do so, we would argue, only from\\nwithin a form of social life already constituted by\\nthe ways of talking in which such words In used;\\nthus the entities they denote are known, not for\\nwhat they Are in themselves, but in terms of their\\ncurrency in our di\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'erent modes of social life, that\\nis, in terms of what it i: one can achieve in every-\\nday activities by their use.\\n\\nThe Centrality of our \"Accountin; Prac-\\ntlces\"\\n\\nThis approach implies that we cmnot take\\nour \"lived\" experience as in my way basic; indeed,\\nfrom our point of view it become! a problem as to\\nwhy we, at this moment in history, experience our-\\nselves u we dm\\xe2\\x80\\x94u if we all existed from birth as\\nseparate, isolated individuals, containing wholly\\nwithin ourselves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmind!\" or \"mentalities,\" set over\\nagainst a material world itself deVeid d my men-\\ntal processes. In our experience of remembering, at\\nleast, in what we speak of as our experience of\\nremembering, \"There is in us something like I pic-\\nture or impression,\" says Aristotle (De Memoria et\\nReminscientia, 4501)}; \"memory demands an\\nimage\" says Russel] (Analysis of Mind); hut, in m\\nsaying, Aristotle, Russell, ourselves Ind countless\\nothers forget the inde\\xef\\xac\\x81nitely many everyday occa-\\nsions in which no such experience of referring to an\\n\"inner\" image in order to remember occuw-in\\nremembering how to spell and to write the words\\nof this paper, for the most put, no such consults.-\\ntion of memory images has occurred. or did it\\xe2\\x80\\x98?...\\nYou perhaps wmt to any: \"I must have done it,\\nperhlps unconsciously. How else could ,the\\nremembering have been done if not by the consul-\\ntation of A copy, image, trace, or whatever,\\nrepresenting what one remembers?\" But must it?\\nWhat are the facts here? What can we remember\\nfrom our own experience of remembering, And\\nwhat of it do we forget, And for whnt reason?

Mill: (1940, p.\\n904), put forwud n :imilu\\' view in the following\\nwords:\\n\\nThe cmmly Nnumm ollh mem ./ Clm\\xe2\\x80\\x99v\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xef\\xac\\x81n Hum cumin Jlnunry 1931, Volume 9, Number 1 n\\n\\nThe major reorientation of recent\\ntheory and observation in sociology of\\nlanguage emerged with the overthrow\\nof the Wundtian notion that language\\nhas us its function the \"expression\" of\\nprior elements within the individual\\n[ie those elements being said in their\\nturn to he based upon impressions\\ncaused within the individual by exter-\\nnal events: 15.}. The postulate under-\\nlying modern study of language is the\\nsimple one thnt we must appromch\\nlinguistic behaviour, not by referring it\\nto private states in individuals, but by\\nobserving its social function of co\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nordinating diverse action. Rather than\\nexpressing something which is prior\\nAnd in the person, language is taken by\\nother persons as an indicator of future\\nactions.\\n\\nMills described this as the functiun of\\nlanguage within the context of discussing people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\naccounting practices; that is, within the context of\\ndiscussing how people render, what in otherwise\\npnnling, senseless, or indeterminate activity visi\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nble is a familiar, sensible, and determinate com-\\nmon place occurrence, An account works As an aid\\nto perception, literally instructing one both in how\\nto see something u I. commonplace event, and, in\\nso seeing it, appreciating the opportunities it oll\\'eis\\nfor one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own further action. As Mills (p. 904) put\\nit, in describing the function of \"motive\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mcounts\"\\nin explaining people\\xe2\\x80\\x98s conduct:\\n\\nMotiVes are imputed 0r avowed as\\nanswers to questions interrupting uts\\nor programs.

This is so because, as Bartlett\\n(1932, p. 253), initially realized:\\n\\nPsychologically speaking, a social\\ngroup is never merely a collection of\\npeople, but is always in some way\\norganized. There must be some active\\nin\\xef\\xac\\x82uence which, so long as it is\\nelfective, brings and holds together the\\npeople who make up the group,\\n\\nAnd he goes on (p. 255):\\n\\nEvery social group is organized and\\nheld together by same speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c psycho-\\nlogicnl tendency or group of tendencies,\\nwhich give the group a bias in its deal-\\nings with external circumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\n[such . bins: 1.5.} immediately settlels]\\nwhat the individual will observe in his\\nenvironment and what he will connect\\nfrom his past life with this direct\\nresponse.

Hence: as our interest is in the phenomena\\nthemselves, in the real nature of thought and\\nmemory, etc., the right method is surely the direct\\nexperimental study of the phenomenar-the actual\\n(or socalled) \"memory traces,\" the nature of the\\nactual for so-called) \"memories\" containing them:\\nthe \"sensory registers\" (the visual icon, the STM\\nand the LTM), the actual (or so-called] \"retrieval\\nprocesses,\" etc., etc. Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid I disagree;\\nsuch an interest seems to me to be misdirected and\\nmistaken, My interest in the \"nature of the men-\\ntal\" is a concern with how talk in aueh terms func-\\ntions to constitute and reconstitute forms of social\\naction, and, one might add, the experiences sus-\\ntaining these forms of action\\n\\nWhile there is a sense in which we know\\nwhat phenomena are signi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed by the use of such\\nwords as \"think,\" \"imagine,\" \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremember,\" etc.,\\nthat sense is merely that we do think, imagine and\\nremember, and can say so, not that we eommand a\\nclear view at all of what thinking, imagining or\\nremembering is; they are words we use in our ways\\nof talking in accounting for ourselves to one\\nanother. And if C.W. Mills and Wittgenstein are\\nright, there is nothing as such which \"thinking.\"\\n\"imagining,\" or \"remembering\" ie--the use of such\\nwords is not to refer to private states \"in\" indivi-\\nduals. We fail to command a clear view as to\\nwhat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremembering\\xe2\\x80\\x9c is\\xe2\\x80\\x94and evidence of that\\nfailure is manifested in the puzzles and problems\\nwe raise and in the confused manner in which we\\ntry to solve them~l>ecause there is not a clear view\\nas such to he hadi We wonder how it is that a\\n\\nperson can \"recall,\" \"retrieve,\" or \"refer to\" some\\n\"thing\" from the past. And then we hasten to\\nconstruct all kinds of theories in response to this\\nquestion, imputing all kinds of properties to\\nprocesses going on inside the person, instead of\\nprobing the dubious presuppositions underlying\\nthe question itself: a) that there is some \"thing\"\\nor \"trace\" of a thing past \"inside\" the person to\\nwhich reference is made; and b) that there is such\\na \"how\" for every \"doing\"--instead of these being\\nactivities which persons, in accounting for them-\\nselves as persons, must talk of themselves as just\\ndoing; i.e., that there are unaccountable doings\\nupon which all our accountable doings are based.\\n\\nFor example, to mention a question of\\nWittgenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from The Blue and the Brown\\nBooks (1965, p. 5): How does one know if what\\none is doing is correct? FApecially when it comes to\\nremembering av imagining something. Does one\\ncheck out what one is doing by reference to an\\ninner criterion, by referring it to a copy or image\\nof what is required? Wittgenstein would argue\\nnot.\\n\\nOur problem is analogous to the fol-\\nlowing: II\\' I give someone the order,\\n\"fetch me a red \\xef\\xac\\x82ower from that\\nmeadow,\" how is he to know what sort\\nof \\xef\\xac\\x82ower to bring, as I have only given\\nhim a word? Now the answer one\\nmight suggest \\xef\\xac\\x81rst is that he went to\\nlook for a. red \\xef\\xac\\x82ower carrying a red\\nimage in his mind, and comparing it\\nwith the \\xef\\xac\\x82owers to see which of them\\nhad the colour of the image. Now\\nthere is such a way of searching, and it\\nis not at all essential that the image we\\nuse he a mental one. In fact the pro<\\ncess may be this: I carry a chart co\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nordinating names and coloured squares.\\nWhen I hear the order \"fetch me, etc.\"\\nI drew my \\xef\\xac\\x81nger across the chart from\\nthe word \"red\" to a certain square, and\\nI go and look [or a flower which has the\\nsame colour as the square But this is\\nnot the only way of searching and it is\\nnot the usual way. We go, look about\\nus, walk up to a \\xef\\xac\\x82ower and pick it,\\nwithout comparing it to anything. To\\nsee that the procus 0f obeying an order\\ncan be of this kind, consider the order,\\n\\nn: 9mm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d leum um.

Putting the\\nmatter thus allows us to recognize that our origi-\\nnal queetion, \"How is it that a person can \\xe2\\x80\\x98recall,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\netc., something from the past?\" is in fact ambigu-\\nous, in that we might be asking either:\\n\\n1. What \"in\" us enables us ta Act in that\\nway? Or,\\n\\n2. What socially are the enabling condi-\\ntions?\\n\\nCurrently, instead of investignting the actual,\\neveryday social circumstances in which Appeals to\\nremembering are used and wu\\'nmted in our\\naccounting practices, ie, what socially are the\\nconditions making memory possible, we epeenlute\\nupon the role of \"images,\" \"schemata,\" or of the\\n\"propositional structures\" which an meant to he\\n\"in\" ne somewhere, making memory possible\" as if\\nwe cannot be sure about the correctness of mu-\\nmemoriee lacking such an ucount\\xe2\\x80\\x98 We fail to\\nappreciate that to the extent that there in a prob\\nlem of recollecting an object us being indeed the\\nobject one experienced, there is just as much if not\\nmore of a problem, in recognizing I supposed\\n\"image,\" a: A repeat of a. previous imagr-common\\nfeatures, a puellel relational structure, etc., are\\n\\nnot enough. While theorists may have image and\\nobject to compare, real people only have their\\nimages, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they? The meeting of oem-tnin social\\ncriteria are important in determining whether a\\nputative memory is to count us a memory or no --\\nBartlett realized this at \\xef\\xac\\x81rst, but later, seemed to\\nforget it again (Douglas, 1980).\\n\\nRemembering md Forgetting as\\nActivities\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nLet me now turn to a discussion of\\nremembering and forgetting as social institutions.\\nIn Part II of Remembering, Sir Frederic Bartlett\\n[1952, p. 296). makes many such statements as\\nthe following: \"Social organization gives a per-\\nsistent framework into which all detailed recall\\nmust \\xef\\xac\\x81t, and it very powerfully in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence: both the\\nmumer and muttem\\' of teen] e\"\\n\\nFor the early Bmlett--working along with\\nA.C.

But\\nwhat are the principles of selection, and where are\\nthey to be located? In 1923, in Paychology and\\nPrimitive Culture, Butlett was also quite clear as\\nto the answer. They issue from And are to be\\nlocated in the social activities of everyday life:\\nRemembering is an important pert of everyday life\\nand develops so u to meet demands.\\n\\nOne such demand is to do with social control\\nand accountability, with rendering daily social life\\noperable end intelligible. In other words, what is\\nremembered and the manner of its recall must be\\nsuch as to help reproduce a society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social order.\\nBut as Bmlett noted (in 1923, Ch. 4), social life is\\nfull of con\\xef\\xac\\x82icting tendencies prone to disrupt it.\\nThey have to be dealt with in some way, and one\\nway \"mciety hes of deeling with con\\xef\\xac\\x82ict is,\" he\\nsuggested (ibid, p. 105), \"um each of the\\ncon\\xef\\xac\\x82icting tendencies is ueigned its own cheru-\\nteristic sphere of utivity, or its own recognined\\ntime of expression.\" Thus, for example, in noting\\nthe opposition between conservation and curiosity,\\nhe pointed out:\\n\\n1\\xe2\\x80\\x98 Th: Quite\", Neilltun eflk Lllonluy n] Unnpulliue Hum; L\\xe2\\x80\\x98Inllx\\'un, Junnry 1957, Volume 9, Numb\" l\\n\\nCuriosity prompts exploration of the\\nnovel; the basis of conservation rests in\\nblind acceptance of the old (How-\\never) the history of every primitive\\ngroup, in fact, reveaJe certain spheres of\\nactivity within which curiosity is not\\nallowed full sway.\\n\\nWhen applied to memory this theorynoi\\' otherwise\\ncon\\xef\\xac\\x82icting impulses organized into \"spheres of\\nin\\xef\\xac\\x82uence\"--snggests that not only are organized\\nsettings constructed to promote only certain kinds\\nof memories, they also work to hinder others. to\\nhelp produce, as Jacoby (1975) calls it, social\\namnesia, Ln institutionally contrived Iorgetting or\\nrepression of things, if not already known, in fact\\nthen It least experienced. Thus, for the Bmlett of\\n1923, if events do not fit into the frameworks pro-\\nvided by one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x94 into which one\\nhas been socieliled\\xe2\\x80\\x94then they are not remembered.\\n\\nIn Remembering Bartlett takes up this issue\\nof social institutions and their in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence again, but\\nalready he seems to have forgotten his early\\nemphasis upon the socially contrived nature of for-\\ngetting, and there is no speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c treatment of for-\\ngetting as such in Remembering. For instance, he\\ndiscusses the different institutional interests of the\\nZulu: end the Swuis\\xe2\\x80\\x98 At that time the Zulus were\\nthe great warriors greatly interested in fighting1\\nwhile the Swazi: were I somewhat poor and down-\\ntrodden people who could only win in con\\xef\\xac\\x82icts by\\ndiplomacy and guile. \"The anu recalling modes\\nof ancient \\xef\\xac\\x81ghting wee,\" eeye Bartlett (1952, pp.\\n263-264),\\n\\nN .volnhle, excited, emotional,\\ncon\\xef\\xac\\x81dent, dramatici The Swazi on the\\nsame topic was tacitnrn, unmoved,\\nmatter-of-Iact, But the Swazi, recount-\\ning old stories of diplomacy, where ,\\nguile gets the better of might, became\\nmore lively, more volnble, gesticulated\\nmore freely, had inward con\\xef\\xac\\x81dence and\\noutward dramatic form.\\n\\nIn other words, what Butlett calls \"a\\ngroup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preferred persistent tendencies,\" or what\\nothers may call simply its way or form of life, con\\xc2\\xbb\\nstitutes, to quote him again, \"a lasting social\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98mhema\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on the haeie of which much constructive\\nwork in recall may take place\" (ibid, p, 264).\\n\\nThu at that point the book cu still be read\\nas saying that the \"schemes\" which work to organ-\\nile our memories, rather than being wholly in our\\nheads, are putly at least to be found in social\\ninstitutions. This is the view proposed here.\\n\\nIncidentally, Bartlett also notee at that point\\nthat \"there is social control from the auditors to\\nthe nmators\" (ibid. p. 266): The ability to recall\\nand its mode and manner are in\\xef\\xac\\x82uenced in the nu.\\nrater by the dominance or submissivenees ol\\xe2\\x80\\x98 the\\nauditor. People\\'s abilities on not independent of\\ntheir context of usage A point currently coming\\nto prominence in the work of Labov [1969) end\\nMargaret Donaldson [1911), but clearly entici-\\npated here by Bartlett.\\n\\nNow if one\\xe2\\x80\\x98s memories are not organized,\\nconventionalized, end stabililed by such social\\n\"schemas\" then, Bartlett claims, memory is of the\\n\"rote recapituletion\" type Such a type of recall\\nis, he claims, the characteristic ol\\' a way of life, or\\nat least u: aspect of life, in which people have lit-\\ntle or no interest, and in which the interests they\\ndo have are all concrete in character, and where\\nnone of them are dominant. It indicates, he sug-\\ngests, \"that there is no main directing or master\\ntendency at work (in organising the recall), except\\nthe normal \\xe2\\x80\\x98schematic\\xe2\\x80\\x99 temporal one\\xe2\\x80\\x98\" (ibid, p,\\n265]4-thet in, things are remembered eimply in\\norder of their occurrence. But on this pointuthe\\nvalue of a social scheme in organizing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nexperiencey-Bartlett ens, surely, in not being\\nmore radical. He fails to do the imaginative work\\nneeded to grasp what life might be like without\\nany such schemes at all; chaos and disorientation\\nrather than tote recepituletion would snpetvene,\\nsurelyi He also fails to take proper account of the\\nnecessary directedness of all mental activity, its\\ninherent intentionality.\\n\\nAlfred Schlitz (1972, pt 15), the eociel\\nphenomenologist, suggests that, \"If we simply live\\nimmersed in the \\xef\\xac\\x82ow of duration (within the\\nstream of consciousness), we encounter only\\nundi\\xef\\xac\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x98erentiated experiences that melt into one\\nanother in a \\xef\\xac\\x82owing continuum\" nu. self-cancelling\\n\\xef\\xac\\x82ux, without \"places\" of rest to which one can\\nreturn, Without the skill to direct ourselves to\\nre\\xef\\xac\\x82ect upon and constitute the phases within that\\n\\xef\\xac\\x82ow as objects of attention, as \"commonplam,\"\\nthere would be nothing in particular.

And here, ironically, Bartlett proved\\n\\nhimself right, for as Mary Douglas [1980, p. 2.5)\\npoints out, \"The author of the best book on\\nremembering forgot his own \\xef\\xac\\x81rst convictions.

Davydov k Radlikhovkii,\\n1985; Kotulin, 1984; Minick, 19%). It is my opin\\xc2\\xbb\\nion that Leont\\xe2\\x80\\x99ev did not understand, or at hast\\ndid not incorporate into his own approach, many\\nof Vygotsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most powerful insights about semi-\\notic mediation and interpeychological functioning.\\nHowever, as l have argued elsewhere (Werteeh,\\n1985, ch. 7), I also believe thnt Vygotsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\napproach can be extended in important respects by\\nincorporating some of Leont\\xe2\\x80\\x99ev\\'s ideas into it. In\\nputicnlu, I think that Leont\\xe2\\x80\\x98ev\\xe2\\x80\\x99a account of\\nactivity can provide a mechanism for extending\\nVygotsky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account of the sccial beyond the\\ninterpsychological plane. It seems that Vygotshy\\nwas beginning to recognize the need to do this late\\nin his life (cf. Minick, in press), but he did not pm-\\ndnce a complete account of how individual\\n(\"intrapaychological\") and interpeycholagical\\nplanes of functioning are tied to social institutional\\nprocesses, It is only by developing such an account\\nthat the Vygotskim approach can become a\\nl\\'nll\\xef\\xac\\x82edged malyais of mind in society instead of\\nmind as it relates to microsociological,\\ninterpsychnlogical functioning.\\n\\nOne way to deal with these issues in a con-\\ncrete way is to focus on the mediational means\\ninvolved. In his analysis of the tools that mediate\\nhum\\xe2\\x80\\x99m activity, Vygotsky touched on a variety nf\\nitems. ranging from the relatively simple external\\nArtifacts (e,g., tying a knot in a handkerchief to\\nremind oneself of something) to complex aesthetic\\npatterns of inner speech The tools that I want to\\nconsider here fall nearer the inner speech end 0! the\\ncontinuum. These tools are in the form of complex\\nverbal texts, in particular, sociahiatorically evolved\\ndescriptions and explanations of events. For\\nexample, a police report of an event would be a\\ntext, as would an account provided by the news\\nmedia.\\n\\nAn essential fact about such texts is that\\nvarious genres have strict prmiptions for what\\ncounts as a good description or explanation.\\n\\nFurthermore, genres typically differ in their\\nprescription; Thus certain facts that must appear\\nin police reports of a crime are typically left out of\\nnews accounts and vice versa\\xe2\\x80\\x98 Many of these\\ndi\\xef\\xac\\x81\\'erencea cannot be accounted for in terms of\\naccuracy or truthfulness; instead, they are\\ndi\\xef\\xac\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x98erences in what it is appropriate to represent\\nand how it is appropriate to (In so. For this 1-\",\\nson, the selection of a puticnlar text genre place! a\\nvariety of constraints on whnt can \\'be said and how\\nit can be expressed.\\n\\nThe issue of how these and other mediational\\nmeans are selected is something that Vygotshy did\\nnot deal with in any great detajlt A \\xef\\xac\\x81rst step in\\nany attempt to do so would be to extend his tool\\nanalogy to a tool kit analogy\\xe2\\x80\\x98 By talking about\\ntool kits rather than tools, we are making an\\nimportant statement about the relationship\\nbetween psychological processes on the one hand\\nand aociohistorical and cultural forces on the other.\\nThe modi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation in the metaphor means that\\ninstead of viewing mediational means as ironclad\\ndeterminer: of these processes, they are seen as\\nproviding a set of options that at least in principle\\nallow some choice and some possibility of emanci-\\npation from established patterns. Schudson (1956)\\nhas dealt with these issues in connection with what\\nhe terms an \"optimistic\" view of culture in which\\nindividuals or groups are seen as having some\\ndegree of conscious choice in the mediational\\nmeans they employ when approaching tasks. In\\ncontrast, a pessimistic view of culture sees culture\\nas constraining us in \\xef\\xac\\x81xed, deterministic ways, the\\nconsequences of which are that we are not aware of\\nthem and hence have little hope of bringing them\\nunder our control.\\n\\nIn accordance with the tool kit analogy an\\nindividual or group is viewed as approaching a\\ntask setting that requires a mental function [e.g.,\\nmemory) in such a way that seven] di\\xef\\xac\\x82erent\\noptions are at least in principle available for deal-\\ning with it. The existence of a range of choices,\\nhowever, doea not mean the task is represented\\nand solved. It is in connection with the evolution\\nof these instruments as well as in connection with\\nthe [ones that shape their use that we need to go\\nbeyond the individual 01\\' small group and examine\\nsociohistorical and culture] forces.\\n\\n20 1\\')\\xc2\\xbb 0mm.

In all uses these results have\\nled investigators to note that people privilege the\\nuse of one mediation] means over others and ask\\nhow this process shapes the way these subjects can\\nrepresent and solve a task.\\n\\nThe pmiculu example of privilexing mediutional\\nmeans that I nhnll examine here comes from the\\nresearch of Bellnh, et nl. (1985) These authors\\nhave examined vuious ways in which contem-\\nporary Americans think and talk about individual-\\nism end commitment A fundamental construct\\nthat they employ to make their case is that of\\n\"lnngunge.\" In this connection they state:\\n\\nWe do not use language in this hook to\\nmean primnrily what the linguist stu-\\ndies. We use the term or refer to\\nmodes of moral discourse that include\\ndistinct vocabuluies and characteristic\\npatterns of moral reasoning.

We use\\nthe term ueond language to refer to\\nother forms, primarily biblical and\\nrepublicnn, that provide at least part of\\nthe moral discourse of most Americans.\\n(p 334).\\n\\nWhat Bellnh, et a]. call language in what I have\\nabove called text, and the various languages to\\nwhich we have access may be thought of u too]: in\\nn hit of mediational means. Hence Americans gen-\\nerally hnve necess to more than one lmgunge when\\nthey describe and explain their own md others\\npatterns of thought and beh-vior.\\n\\nAlthough Bellnh, et u]. do not go into detail\\nin the medietionnl role of languages, they assume\\nthat when a speaker begins to speak in one\\nlanguage IS opposed to Another there are powerful\\nconstraints on what that speaker can think and\\nsay This is re\\xef\\xac\\x82ected in statements such as,\\n\"Given this individualistic morn] framework, the\\nself becomes n crucial site {or the comparative\\nexamination and prnbing of feelings that result\\nfrom ultilituinn nets and inspire expressive ones\"\\n(1). 73). Thus, implicit in their view is the claim\\nthat spenkers shape the situation by choosing a\\nlnnguage, but they Are in turn shaped in whet they\\ncan say by this choice. of course this does not\\nmean that a speaker in permnnently frozen into a\\nputiculu- text or \"mode of moral discourse\"--nfter\\nIll, he or she has access to other languages and\\nhence other patterns of thought and speech,\\n\\nWithout even touching on the vast majority\\nof issues raised by Bellnh, et nJ. I would like to\\noutline a few general implications that their Argu-\\nments hnve for collectively organised mediationul\\nmeans in general And for collective memory in par-\\nticulu. The \\xef\\xac\\x81rst of these is that the languages\\nthey mention are put And parcel of a sociohintori-\\ncal end cultural system; there is no sense in which\\nthey are appropriate, powerful, useful, and so forth\\nin an absolute, universal, or nhistoricnl way. In\\ndifferent societiu today ud during different\\nperiods of American history the languages, or at\\nleast what serves as n \\xef\\xac\\x81rst lnnguuge, could be quite\\ndifferent. Hence, what in available in pnrticnlux\\npeople\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tool kits depends in u central way on their\\nsueiohistoricnl and cultural situntion.\\n\\nFurthermore, Bellnh, et :11. do not redly\\naddress this issue, there are probably important\\ndi\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'erences in when and where members of n putic-\\nulnr culture choose to use one as opposed to\\nmother of the lnngunges to which they have\\nween.

This\\nwas recorded at a. point when the practice perfor-\\nmance of the Morris Dance they were attempting\\nto learn had fallen into complete disarray Study\\nof the dancers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dialogue demonstrates the impor-\\ntance of remembering collectively for the mainte-\\nnance and re\\xe2\\x80\\x94creation of such folk traditions.\\nConversetionelly mediated remembering created\\nthe basis for working out their dif\\xef\\xac\\x81culties in per-\\nforming the dance. The transcribed conversation\\nrevealed the nature end variety of the mnemonic\\nresources the team members brought to beer, both\\nin the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the terms used to describe the\\ndance, and in the working out of just how the\\nsequence of dunce moves \\xef\\xac\\x81tted together. These\\nresources were instrumental in integrating the\\nknowledge for the dance of individual participants\\nwith their collective team effort to learn a speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c\\ndance that was new to their repertoire. of pnticu\\xc2\\xbb\\nlnr interest was the the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of negotiation\\nand Argument to de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne and conventionelite their\\ndance vocabulary. Such locally de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned shared\\nunderstanding of the dance terminology can be\\nviewed as one means of embodying the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s col-\\nlective memory for the Morris dance.\\n\\nThis diecnssion is part of a series of studies\\nconcerned with exploring the mnemonic potential\\nof canverentionnl Mtivity (see for example:\\nEdwards and Middleton, 1986;; 1956b; Middleton\\nand Edwards, 1986) In those studies we have\\nanalysed how conversational activity allows people\\nto coordinate their various versions of the pest.\\nOur aim has been to understand how the\\nmnemonic demands of everyday life are met as A\\n\\njoint rather then u an individual enterprise. The\\neonEern was to explore the functionll strategies\\npeople employ when jointly working out their vee-\\ntions of past events: such as how newly recalled\\nitems of information are introduced into the group\\nconversation; how links are established between\\nthe original experience and the converutione]\\nmeant; and how does one person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remembering\\netfect another. This led to the recording of exem-\\nples of joint recall in a number of situations:\\nincluding family discussions of photographs; stu~\\ndent discussions of previously presented clue\\nmaterial; and people reminiscing The section of\\ntranscribed conversation discussed here is another\\nexample of the qualitative analysis of the content\\nand process of conversational remembering.\\n\\nHowever, it is not just I. replication in\\nanother context of our previous work. The analysis\\nand discussion aims to focus more directly on\\nremembering a: a socio\\xe2\\x80\\x94cultural activity.\\nRemembering collectively is shown to be en\\nutivity that Alford; the distribution of the\\nmnemonic burden; the collective coordimtion of a\\nvuiety of mnemonic resources; the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of\\nmnemonic roles and related division of labour\\nbetween the team members; and the conventionnli-\\ntation of Vocuhulu\\xe2\\x80\\x99y of terms that help de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne and\\npruerve their knowledge of the dance In other\\nwords, the study of remembering occur: within a\\nsocietal or socio\\xe2\\x80\\x94culturnl context, a context where\\nthe sociel in\\xef\\xac\\x82uence is not simply the result of the\\nimmediacy of joint activity but stems from an\\ninstrumentally mediated wciulity (Engestrb\\'m,\\n1986]. Such an instrumentelity results from\\nactivity manifested in the products uld practices\\nembodied in social customs and institutions,\\nartifacts and tools, language and terms vfrd\\'erence\\nof human culture. In that sense remembering is\\nbeing examined as a culturally mediated collective\\nactivity that incorporates the historical dimension\\nin everyday psychological functioning.

The dance routines bear hall-\\nmau-lu of fertility rites and other aspects an\\napparently symbolic of work and \\xef\\xac\\x81ghting.\\nTowards the end of the last century it was believed\\nthat the tradition was in danger of dying out and\\nfolklorists made determined e\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'ort: to annotate\\nhath the dance moves and the music. Since then\\nthere has been a considerable growth of interest in\\nMorris Dancing. Many revival team: now exist\\nand the tradition continues to evolve and grow\\nwith all the attendant debates of purity and\\nauthenticity that permeate the \"folk scene.\"\\n\\nThe usual form of a six person dmce is a\\neerie: of sequences involving a \"\\xef\\xac\\x81gure\" and a\\n\"chorus.\" The \"\\xef\\xac\\x81gures\" change as the dance\\nprogresses but the \"chorus\" remains the sme and\\nis usually repeated after each of the chmging\\n\"\\xef\\xac\\x81gures.\" The basic sequence of movements for\\nmost dances in of the following form:\\n\\nm Figure followed by a Chorus movement;\\n2nd Figure followed by the same Chorus\\nmovement; etc, through the dance up to 5 or\\n6 \"\\xef\\xac\\x81gures\"\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\n\\nOf particular interest here is a commonly\\noccurring \"chorus\\xe2\\x80\\x9c movement called I \"hnlf-hey.\"\\nThis simply inverts the set as shown in the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst\\nput of Figure 2. After the the \"hnlI-hey\" move-\\nment the dancers who were originally in the 1 and\\n2 positions end up at the \"bottom\" of the \"set\"\\nand the dances originally in the 5 and 6 position\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81nish at the \"top\" of the \"set.\" The dancers in the\\n\"middle\" 3 and 4 positions return to where they\\nstarted.

The exact\\ndetails of the problem they fued will be described\\nshortly.\\n\\nThe General Problem\\n\\nThe critical feature of the episode was the\\nworking out as a joint utivity of an agreed\\nde\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of what to call and how to execute e\\nproblematic \"chorus\" sequence. It was precisely\\nbecame the team was nttempting to leun an\\nunfamiliar tradition, within their Morris reper-\\ntoire, that there wns no agreed de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the\\nterms of reference used to deecribe the quneneee\\nthat made up the \"chorus.\" Consequently the exe\\xc2\\xab\\ncution oi\\' the dance became problematic and\\ndiscoordineted. At a point of extreme diecoordina\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntion the team spontaneously started discussing and\\ndemonstrating their performance of the dance,\\nThis included, amongst other things, de\\xef\\xac\\x81ning the\\nmeaning of the terms of the dance vocabulary and\\nworking out the implications for their positioning\\nwithin the \"set\"\\n\\nThe Dul Problem Faced by the Tenm\\n\\nThe discussion revolved around the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition\\nof how to execute what the team vuioueiy referred\\nto es the \"helf-hey,\" \"i\\xe2\\x80\\x99uII-hey\\'I or \"wholehey\"\\nmovement within the \"chorus\" of e dance called\\n\"Lads e Eunchnm.\" There were two critical\\nfeatures of this dance that the team had not fully\\nappreciated at the point at which the recording\\nwas startedt First, the dance was from a tradition\\nthat was structurally more complex than the\\ndances they had previously been used to dancing.\\nThe chums divided into two repeated parts which\\nincluded the dancing of two \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheys.\" Second the\\nnature 0f the \"hey\" movement could not be\\nde\\xef\\xac\\x81ned as either a \"helf-hey\" or as e \"whoIe-hey,\"\\n(or \"full-hey\"). It was in fact a movement known\\nme a \"elip\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey\" (Figure 3, p. 24). This movement\\nhas very di\\xef\\xac\\x81erent consequences on the position of\\nthe dancers in the set after its tompletion then the\\nother two \"hey!\" that the team were familiar with.\\n\\nThe teem {Iced a dull problem of working\\nout of a de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the \"hey\" movement relevant\\n\\nto the new tradition. In Addition, they had to come\\nto appreciate that the overall structure of the\\n\"chorus\" of the dmee did not follow the basic and\\nfamiliar pattern of other duces in their repertoire\\n\\nFirst Problem: \"Slip\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey\" Vi. \"half-hey\"\\n\\nThe \"hey\" u put of the \"chorus\" of the\\ndance could in fact be described u l \"slip-hey.\"\\nThis type of \"hey\" is radically di\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'erent from the\\nmore frequently occurring \"helf-hey\" already\\ndescribed above. Instead of the set ending up\\ninverted, the \"1\\xe2\\x80\\x99: h 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" move down to the \"hot-\\ntom\\xe2\\x80\\x9c of the set and the other four dancers \"slip\"\\nup the let one position to \\xef\\xac\\x81ll the gap left by \"1\\xe2\\x80\\x995 8;\\n2\\xe2\\x80\\x995,\" Figure 2 (p. 24) represent: these difference:\\nbetween the \"helf-hey\" And the \"sliphey\"\\ndiagrammatically,\\n\\nSecond Problem: The \"Structure\" of the\\nDance\\n\\nThe complication in the structure of \"Led: a\\nBunchum\" stems from the fact the \"chorus\" is not\\na. simple repetition of the sune movement as the\\ndance progresses. It hes changing features thlt\\nactually give the dance its overall distinctiveness.\\nThe structure of the dance can he clearly die-\\ntinguished from the usual \"Figure I followed by a\\nChorus; then Figure 2 followed by the same\\nchorus; etc., until all the \\xef\\xac\\x81gures have been com-\\npleted.\" There are changing \"comer movements\"\\nwithin each \"chorus.\" The exact nature of the\\n\"corner movements\" need not concern us here.\\nThey simply involve executing a dance move with\\nthe person diagonally opposite in the \"set\"; ie., 1\\nwith 6, then 2 with 5, and \\xef\\xac\\x81nally 3 with 4. The\\ndeuce therefore takes the following form:\\n\\nFirst, Figure I followed by a \"Chorus\" which\\nis itself mede up of:\\n\\nlet \"Comer movements\\xe2\\x80\\x9c ( by diagonal pairs\\none after the other}, followed by \"slip\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey\";\\nthen repeat lst \"Corner movements\" foi-\\nlowed by enother \"elip-hey\\xe2\\x80\\x98\"\\n\\nSecond, Figure 2 followed by u. \"Chorus\"\\nwhich again is made up of:\\n\\nn: Qumny Nmmm ./ lhe Lehnlnrv u; oumnn\\xe2\\x80\\x98n 1mm Cognirium Jmulry 1981, Volume 9, Number I :5\\n\\n2nd \"Corner movements\" (by diagonal pairs\\none after the other) followed by \"slip hey\";\\nthen repeat 2nd \"Corner movements\" fol.\\nlowed by another \"slip-hey,\"\\n\\nThis basic pattern is repeated until all the\\n\"\\xef\\xac\\x81gure\" and \"chorus\\xe2\\x80\\x9c movements have been exe-\\ncuted. It uh be appreciated th.t Although the\\n\"chorus\" is complex. the inclusion of two \"slip-\\nheys,\" returns the dancers to their starting posi-\\ntions in the \"set\" ready for the next \"\\xef\\xac\\x81gure.\"\\n\\nTowards Identifying the Dual Problem\\n\\nThe transcript reveals a gradual working\\ntowards the team exphcitly recognizing the dual\\ncomplexity of the dance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \"slip-hey\\xe2\\x80\\x9c and \"chorus\"\\nmovements. An initial inspection of the conversa-\\ntion shows how the changing de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the\\n\"hey,\" and where it \\xef\\xac\\x81tted into the complex struc-\\nture of the \"chorus,\" provided an important con-\\nstraint on the content of the discussion. It was not\\nthe case that the team we: tatally ignorant of\\nwhat to do, but to socialize Bartlett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phrase, the\\ndiscussion represented their \"e\\xef\\xac\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x98ort after a con-\\nsenaus of meming\" concerning competing interpre-\\ntations of their performance of the dance.

Then were many examples nf the use\\nof umphorie reference and connective terms that\\nserved to link together contributions concerning\\nthe semantics and pragmatic: of the dance perfor\\xc2\\xbb\\nmance. For example, enephoric terms of reference\\nsuch as \"this,\" \"that\" and \"it\" were used in con-\\nnection with linking buk to previous demonetun\\ntions of the dance (eg,: lines 4, 30 end 82 to 92); to\\nprevious interpretations of position (eg.: line 30\\nwith respect movement within the \"chorus\"; lines\\n27 end 65 with respect to whether the \"hey\"\\ninverted ox- slipped the \"set\"); to the number of\\nbars in the musical accompaniment (eg.: lines 8, 9\\nend 17); to previous de\\xef\\xac\\x81nitions of terms used to\\ndescribe the \"hey\\xe2\\x80\\x9c (95.; lines 24 ud 54); ml\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81nally reference to the handbook containing writ-\\nten versions of the dances (line 44) Examples of\\nconnective terms and phrases, used to predicate\\nnew contributions on previous ones, thus establish-\\ning a form of coherent and interrelated argument,\\nwere the use of: \"because\" (lines 11, 33, 59); \":0\"\\n(line 13); \"yeh hilt,\" \"but you\" (line: 25 and 56);\\nand \"doee that imply\" (line 68).

What was particularly interesting\\nwas the mullet in which their contributions to the\\nconversation were framed, A numher of issues\\nformed the basis to establish criteria for evaluating\\ncompeting suggestions concerning what to do next.\\nThose issues were concerned with aspects of the\\ndance that were products Ind inventions of the\\nMorris dancing eub\\xe2\\x80\\x94enltui-e1 eg, the music, the\\nvocabulary of terms, and the nature of the move-\\nments, and as such they embodied various dimen-\\nsions of the history of past performance In that\\nsense they constituted a form of collective memory\\nfor the dance in the way they served to constrain\\nand regulate the direction and content of the\\nteam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discussion.\\n\\nOutline of Mnemonie Resources Used by the\\nTeam (Figure 3, next page)\\n\\nFive main categories of resource can be\\nidenti\\xef\\xac\\x81ed from the transcript, they included: the\\nhandbook containing an annotated version of the\\ndance; the accompanying music as a yard stick for\\nworking out the timing and length of .hy particu-\\nlar movement; actual demonstrations and reference\\nto demonstrations of how to perform particular\\nfeatures of the dance; positional consequences for\\nthe dancers of their movement within the \"set\"\\nwith respect to whether the \"hey\" inverted or\\nslipped positions, and with respect to the overall\\nexecution at the \"charm\" movements; um hhhny,\\nde\\xef\\xac\\x81nition and rede\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the vocabulary\\ndescribing essential features of the dmce. There\\nare obvious overlaps across some of those\\ncategories of resource. However, they are not out-\\nlined as mutually exclusive of one another, but as\\noverlapping frames of reference that had functional\\nsigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cance in the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to resolve their\\ndif\\xef\\xac\\x81culties.\\n\\nGeneral Use and Distribution of Mnemomie\\nResources\\n\\nGeneral use of mnemonic resources.\\nWhat was puticularly interesting in the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstruggle to appreciate where they had gone wrong\\nwas the variety of resources they were willing to\\nentertain as providing an in\\xe2\\x80\\x94rond into their prob-\\nlems. Figure 3 represents the distribution of use of\\nthose resources by the dancers. The \\xef\\xac\\x81gure\\nidenti\\xef\\xac\\x81es which dancers drew 06 which resource as\\ntheir conversation developed. Interestingly, what\\nmight be thought to be the most accessible and\\neelf-evident means of solving their problems were\\nnot necessarily the ones immediately adopted by\\nthe team. For example, the written notes in the\\nhandbook, and actual demonstrations, might be\\nthought to have o\\xef\\xac\\x82ered straightforward means of\\ndetermining where they had gone wrong and what\\nthey should do next. Both those resources were\\nbrought into play by the dancers but not to the\\nexclusion of other frame: of reference.\\n\\nWritten notes. The handbook certainly\\naltered a useful source of reference inccrpornting\\nannotated versions of previous performances of the\\ndance In that sense it embodied a form of collec-\\ntive memory of how to perform the dancer This\\nwas recognired by \"T,\" and he made persistent\\nenerts to incorporate information from the book\\ninto the discussion (see lines 29, 44, 98, 108). \"T\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\"\\nbook related contributions covered both aspects of\\nthe dual problem: the nature of the \"hey\" move-\\nment as de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned by the movement of the \"middies\"\\n(line 108), and the complexity of the \"chorus\"\\nmovement [lines 23, 29, and 44). At best though,\\nthe references to the book were only acknowledged\\nby other team members as con\\xef\\xac\\x81rmation of the\\nauthenticity of whnt had already been concluded\\nin earlier discussion (eg, lines 44-48). There was\\nno general attempt to take the book IS the key\\ninterpretative end mnemonic resource.

Number 1\\n\\nthe handbook, Whilst not explicitly referred to\\nin the conversation, handbooks very often create\\nproblems in their own right because they lack con-\\nsistency in their terms of reference and description.\\nFor example, the handbook the team was using\\n(Bacon, 1974), referred to the \"hey\" as both a\\n\"half\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey\" as read out by \"T\\xe2\\x80\\x9c (line 49), and as a\\n\"alip\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey\" in its description of \"Lads a Bunchum.\"\\nIn addition, taking meaning [torn a written text\\nplaced an extra burden, or step, in the interpreta-\\ntive Activity of the team. It was easier to work\\nthrough the implications of what has just been\\nphysically performed or demonstrated than to\\nwork a hypothetical version from the book and\\nthen map that onto any past or prospective perfor-\\nmance. Finally, the team was attempting to learn\\na dance that was new to their repertoire The use\\nof a handbook is less problematic when used as a\\nreminder of what to do for dances already in that\\nrepertoire rather than as a. resource for new addi\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ntions to it, In one sense the written versions of the\\ndances are only a guide \"that\" something can be\\ndone. They do not and cannot totally encompass\\n\"how\" the dances should or could be performed.\\nEven if there were a fully consistent conventional\\nnotation recording the \"Morris,\" that would not\\ncompletely re\\xef\\xac\\x82ect what the dance is in its perforv\\nmance. That knowledge can only be fully\\nexpreeeed in the continuing re-performance of the\\ndance, That is the very essence of a living cultural\\ntradition. The team was in the business of creat-\\ning a context that allowed them to assess the\\ne\\xef\\xac\\x81ieacy of their performances, or as one of them\\nput it, in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nal analysis: \"do it again and see\\nwhat looks nice\" (line 66).\\n\\nDemonstrations and reference to\\ndemonstrations. Physical demonstration of\\nwhat to do and reference by team members to\\nthose demonstrations were certainly a signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant\\nfeature of the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s search for a viable version of\\nthe dance It was the \"foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" appeal for\\ncontinuation from team member: that he had pro-\\nduced an acceptable version that created the initial\\ngrounds for the discussion [line 4). However, the\\nsigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cance of any demonstration had to he\\nworked out and articulated within the overall con-\\ntext of the unfolding discussion In themselves the\\ndemonstrations, which were all performed by the\\n\"foreman\" (lines 80, 93 and 115), did not resolve\\nanything until the team had worked up criteria for\\nmarking the distinctive features of the dance on\\n\\nthe basis of other resources. While the \"foreman\"\\nmay well have worked out what to do and have\\nincorporated it into his performance, the successful\\ncommunication of the salient features of that\\ninterpretation rested in, and was mediated by, the\\nensuing discussion. That process of negotiation\\nserved two purposes. It rati\\xef\\xac\\x81ed the authenticity of\\na particular interpretntion ol the competing\\ndemonstrations of the dance initially offered by the\\n\"foreman\" in his role as tutor, and at the same\\ntime provided the means of transmitting an expli-\\ncit appreciation of that rati\\xef\\xac\\x81ed version to other\\nmembers of the team.\\n\\nExplicit reference to the \"forernan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\"\\ndemonstration served a number of purposes and\\nwas need by numerous members of the team as the\\ndiscussion progressed. Both dimensions of the dual\\nproblem were handled in that way (eg.: the struc-\\nture of the \"chorus\" at line 30; and the \"hey\"\\nmovement At line 58]. However, the most\\nsigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cant use of reference to demonstration\\noccurred well into the discussion immediately fol-\\nlowing the \"foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" \\xef\\xac\\x81rst re-demonstration of\\nwhat to do (line 80). At that point the team had\\nestablished a common frame of reference that\\nallowed them to evaluate that re-demonstration in\\nrelation to what they thought they had attempted\\nto dmce and in relation to the \"foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" earlier\\ncontradictory demonstrations (lines 5! to 92).\\nThis latter point will be elaborated in a later dis-\\ncussion of the overall distribution of the resources\\nwithin the conversation.\\n\\nPositional consequences. It was inevit-\\nable that consequences of position within the \"set\"\\nshould have been A signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant aspect of the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndiscussion. The very essence of their problem lay\\nin where they should have moved to u the dance\\nprogressed. Discussion of the consequences for\\ndancer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position within the \"set\" therefore mir-\\nrored the critical features or the two problems they\\nfaced: the unique nature of the \"hey\" And the com-\\nplexity of the \"chorust\"\\n\\nIt has already been pointed out that the crit-\\nical feature of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chey\" was that it did not lead to\\ninversion of the \"set.\" This aspect was initially\\nbroached by \"T\" (lines 1 and 13 referring to \"turn-\\ning the set up side down\"), and \"A\" (line 25: \"how\\ndo you \\xef\\xac\\x81nish off in opposite corners then\").

The transcript shows that the\\nmusic was used on a number of nccesions to pro\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nvide a framework of interpretation (lines: 8; 9; 17;\\n21; 22; 503 80; 128). At a genera| level the music\\nwas seen to be an accurate arbiter of what to do.\\nThat cm be seen re\\xef\\xac\\x82ected in \"SEE\" comment (line\\n22: \"the music is always right C\"), and in \"D\\'s\"\\ncomment (line 125: \"it \\xef\\xac\\x81ts the music\").

The implications of his\\ninterpretation was immediately challenged by two\\nmusicians, [lines 9 end 17). As has already been\\ndiscussed, the version of the dance proposed by\\n\"E\" to \\xef\\xac\\x81t the music led to l.\\xe2\\x80\\x9c inaccurate\\nrede\\xef\\xac\\x81nition by \"V\" of the \"hey\" u a \"whole\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey.\"\\nThat could only come about because of the\\ncon\\xef\\xac\\x81dence the dancers placed in the muaic u m\\nnccurlte bench mu-h for walking out plausible\\nthernstives to problematic moves. Whilst the\\ninterpretation o\\xef\\xac\\x82ered by \"E\" in that inetnnee\\n\\nproved to be in error. it was the working out of the\\nimplications of the number of hers available to\\ndance that initiated the discussion to rede\\xef\\xac\\x81ne the\\n\"hey\" and place it in its appropriate context\\nwithin the \"chorus\" ofthe dance.\\n\\nIn comparison with consequences of position\\nand demonstration! both the handbook of dmce\\nnotation end the music were available in written\\nform. However the use of the music was nlwnys in\\nrelation to the muticiens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expertise rather than\\nwith reference to its notation in the book like the\\ndenee notation In that way it was immediately\\nmore Meessible than the dance notation and was\\na\\xef\\xac\\x82orded a di\\xef\\xac\\x82erent level of con\\xef\\xac\\x81dence by the rest\\nof the team.\\n\\nThe vocabulary. The rede\\xef\\xac\\x81nition: of the\\n\"hey\" formed an important resource \\'m the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconversation about the dance. They marked cru-\\ncial bonndnries in an audit by the \"foreman\" of\\nprogress toward u understending of the \"hey\"\\n(line: 24 and 54], end in later identi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation of the\\n\"hey\" as having special properties in the dance in\\nqueltion [lines 65, 74, 76, 77, 119, 122). \"V,\" Is\\nthe \"foreman\" played a prominent role in stating\\nthose rede\\xef\\xac\\x81nition (eg., lines 34, 54, 74, 77).\\n\\nDistribution of the\\nResources\\n\\nUse of Mnemonlc\\n\\nFrom Figure 5 it is possible ta see that dur-\\ning those \\xef\\xac\\x81rst \\xef\\xac\\x81ve sequences the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discussion\\nranged \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[055 all the resources in their eiforts to\\nresolve the problem of the \"hey.\" It was only\\nwhen it became apparent that they were dealing\\nwith a unique and di\\xef\\xac\\x81ennt form of \"hey\" that the\\nfocus of their discussion dramatically shifted to a\\nconcentration on demonstration end reference to\\ndemonstration Is the means of arbitration. This\\ntransition occurred because the team hid crested\\nfor itself a consensus of understanding that allowed\\nthem to identify the distinctive features of the\\ndance in both the \"foreman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" demonstrations and\\ntheir own Attempts M performing the dmee.

The conversa-\\ntion a\\xef\\xac\\x82orded the means of evaluating alternative\\ninterpretations and in so doing brought the team\\ncloser to a point where they could phyeically exe\\ncute the dance.\\n\\nSpecialisation in Use a!

There we: I tendency for\\none member of the team to come back continually\\nto a particular frame of reference in working out\\nwhat to do. This can be seen in \"T\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" use of the\\nhook; \"C\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\" concern with whether the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chey\"\\ninverted the \"set\" or not; \"V\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rede\\xef\\xac\\x81nition: of\\nvocabulary, and use of actual physical demonstra-\\ntions of the dance; and the mueicians\\' Ilse of the\\nmusic as a bench mark for working out what to do.\\n\\nThat division of labour in the team\\'s inter-\\npretative and mnemonic activity can be seen as an\\nexpression of individual diiferences that grow out\\nof the eocio\\xe2\\x80\\x94cnltural basin of human activity.\\nDomain speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c strengthe, weaknesses, inclination:\\nend tnde\\xe2\\x80\\x94o\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'s within any group become embodied\\nin the mnemonic roles people take on as they to]-\\nlectively remember in the service of individual and\\ncorporate goals.

The execution of\\ndemonstrations and the marking of terminological\\nredefinition were products of that organizationally\\nde\\xef\\xac\\x81ned authority. The musicians held a aimilar\\nposition of authority with respect to any calibra-\\ntion of the dance uling metrical properties of the\\nmusic.

The voce-\\nbnlary is an euential tool in the performance of\\nthe dance. It is one of the principal resources that\\ndancers use to know what to do when, or to be\\nreminded during the dance, by othe\\xef\\xac\\x82, of what to\\ndo next. One of the main dil\\xef\\xac\\x81culties novice danc-\\ners face is understanding the \"language\" of the\\ndance Once mastered an individual dancer is no\\nlonger reliant on what they individually remember\\nof any particular dance. It is frequently reported\\nby experienced dancers that they do not \"know\"\\nexactly what to do in a dance until they are actu-\\nally performing it in the \"set.\" They rely on the\\nmutual support of other dancer: who call out the\\nmoves as the dance progresses. The collective\\nknowledge embodied in the terminological \"short-\\nhand\" of the dance a\\xef\\xac\\x81\\'ord: that distribution of the\\nmnemonic burden concerning how the dance is to\\nbe performed amongst the team members. The\\nvocabulary is a culturally created and de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned\\ncorpus of knowledge that is instrumental in the\\nrecall of what to do in the dance and in the coordi-\\nnation of the dmcers\\xe2\\x80\\x99e expertise\\n\\nConventionalisation of the terulinol\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nogy. The nature of the duel problem that faced\\nthe team hinged on the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the vocahu\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\nlary of terms that the team was using to de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne the\\nnature and structure of the dance. The argument\\nhere is that those terms are more than mere\\ndescriptions of what happens at what point in the\\ndance, they are directly instrumental in the\\n\\ncontinuing recreation of the dance. The team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconversation revealed their definition of the \"hey\"\\nwas inapproprinte in relation to the dance they\\nwere attempting to perform. It Wu their attempts\\nto identity when they were going wrong that led\\nnot just to e rede\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of their working\\nde\\xef\\xac\\x81nitions of the terms they were using to describe\\nthe \"hey\\xe2\\x80\\x9c but to the introduction of a completely\\nnew form of description that marked the distinc-\\ntive feature of the \"slip\\xe2\\x80\\x94hey\" in the new Addition\\nto their repertoire, \"Lads a. Bunchum.\" Their\\ndilemma and it: resolution tested in the social\\nactivity that eonventionalized the interpretation of\\nthe \"hey\" terms. Thus while theilI initial interpre-\\ntation: of the \"hey\" were inappropriate, their\\nattempte to make those interpretations \\xef\\xac\\x81t led them\\nto identify the novel features of the \"slip-heyi\" It\\nalso led to the introduction of a term new to their\\nshared vocabulary that would mark those novel\\nfeatures and serve to remind them of what to do\\non subsequent occasions.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nRemembering is habitually treated in the\\npsychological literature as an individual process\\nthat allows people to function appropriately in\\nhath solitary and social circumstances. At the\\nheart of the research endeavor is the assumption\\nthat we each possess a capacity to process and\\nstore for later use salient aspects of our daily\\nexperience and accumlulating knowledge about the\\nworld in which we live The aim has been to\\ndescribe the structure and function of individual\\ncognitive processes that would allow people \\xef\\xac\\x82exible\\naccess to their iudividunl repository of past experi\\xc2\\xbb\\nence and knowledge. Notable exceptions to such an\\napproach have argued that it is impossible to\\nstudy individual cognition divorced from any\\nenvironmental context that constrains and affords\\nthe very cognitive structures and processes under\\ninvestigation, (see Neisser, 1984). The \"ecological\"\\nargument advocates a thorough analysis of\\nenvironmental constraints of the physical world in\\nadvance of detailed consideration and postulatiun\\nof complex cognitive models concerning individual\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmental architecture.\" However, in emphasizing\\nthe physical constraints of the environment there\\nhas been a tendency to ignore the cultural proper-\\nties of both the physical and the social context of\\ncognitive functioning.\\n\\nat m Qurterly Nnnlr\\xef\\xac\\x82n ofthe Lab-uluy of amynmx\\xe2\\x80\\x98ee Huu- 0mm...

Certainly a\\nchange of inferential focus is required that goes\\nbeyond situating the study of individual cognition\\nin ecologically more valid contexts. In addition, it\\nneeds to be recognised that the cultural aspects of\\nhuman activity are not just fortuitous extras that\\nsocially [Militlte the smooth working 01\\' individuul\\ncognitive processes. Human thinking is both\\nembedded and constituted within socio-cultural\\nactivitim. This implies a need to change the con-\\nceptual basis for investigating psychological func-\\ntioning from cognition as All individual to a collec-\\ntively realized utivity. Mnemonic activity is a\\nparticularly appropriate candidate for analysis\\nfrom a collective perspective. Although the major-\\nity of psychological studies have concentrated on\\nthe processes that underpin Accurate retrieval of\\ninformation in both individual md social cir-\\ncumstances there has been little attempt to unlyse\\nit as a social process mediated by the products of\\nculture, such as language, artifacts, tools, social\\ncustoms wd institutions.\\n\\nThis study was concerned with looking\\ndirectly at the content of naturally situated\\nconversational activity as l. collective utivity that\\nAlfords the negotiation of a consensus concerning\\npast events of relevance to present And future\\nactions.\\n\\nBartlett (1932) realized, as did Maurice\\nHalbwachs (1950], the French sociologist who so\\neloquently chunpioned the study of memory from\\na collective perspective, that there is a necessary\\nimprecision, an inexutitude about our individual\\nhold on the past. This is necessary if we are to\\nescape the tyranny of the immediate past in deter-\\nmining our everyday functioning, Psychological\\nfunctioning must be able to deal with en indeter-\\nminate and novel future. Remembering is not an\\nindividual indulgence eerried out for the sake of\\nreminiscing; it serves our present and future\\nactivity As such put experience must be clpable\\nof being \\xef\\xac\\x82exibly Ipplied to contemporary cir-\\ncnmstancea. Remembering collectively affords the\\npossibility of identii\\'ying \\xef\\xac\\x82exible solutions to every-\\nday problems.\\n\\nThe argument presented here is that the\\ndancers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 conversation was instrumental in their\\n\\ncollective remembering and interpretation of the\\ndance they were practicing. The discussion aimed\\nto illustrate important aspects of collective\\nremembering such that it could be justi\\xef\\xac\\x81ably\\nclaimed that the dancers were indeed engaged in a\\ncollective, as opposed to An arbitrary individual\\nexpression of frustration at their feilure to com-\\nplete the dnnee. First, because their conversation\\nu\\xef\\xac\\x82orded the coordinttion of a variety of individual\\nperspectives within an emergent shared under-\\nstanding of the dance. Second1 because the very\\nsubstance of the discussion was formed in, and\\nbounded by, aspects of the dmee that were them-\\nselves products of previous collective Activity\\nwithin the culture of the dancer Those aspects\\nacted as \"mnemonic resources\" that the team\\nmembers struggled to \"take meaning\" from, (in\\nShirley Brice\\xe2\\x80\\x94Heath\\xe2\\x80\\x99e [I982] sense), in their collee-\\ntive semh for what to do in the dance The\\njusti\\xef\\xac\\x81cation for describing them as \"mnemonic\\nremnrces\" lay in their potential for bridging past\\nwith present performances As such the use of\\nthose resources took the discussion beyond an arbi-\\ntrary and immediate weiahility into a eultnnlly\\neonstrnined utivity. That activity ineorponted\\nmotives for their performance that went beyond\\nany immediate actions toward their stated goal of\\ngetting the dmce going again.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nI would like to acknowledge the coapenition, help Mid\\nencouragement received from: The Forster: Merrie\\nand Sword Dancing Club, Nottingham, England; Joe\\nTaulane n: the Sn.

Children are\\nto be guided along a more persoml path of\\ndevelopment, and it i: as much a process of growth\\nfrom within us of learning what is given.\\nKnowledge is created, constructed by the learner,\\nnot merely passively acquired from textbooks and\\nteacher talk, n\\xc3\\xa9r written upon aome tnbula run.\\nBut it is not rote learning that concern: us here.\\nWe shall Argue that the notion of collective\\n\\nmemory1 and of collective understanding! in gen-\\neral, have much to o\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'et our conception of schoul-\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98 ing. Indeed, they are the key to reconciling the\\n\\nutive, exploratory conception of learning with the\\none strength that the older, traditional sort of\\npedagogy possessed\\xe2\\x80\\x94a recognition of culture, of the\\npre-existence of knowledge. Children do not just\\nhappen to reinvent the knowledge of centuriesv\\n\\nThe important thing about educational\\nknowledge is that it is communal, rather than sim-\\nply personal It is necessary that children acquire\\nskills, knowledge and understandings that they can\\ncommunicate and demonstrate when uked to do\\nsot Teething and learning ue communicative\\ntransactions between teacher and pupils that take\\nplace in the context of lessons, of subjects and of a\\ncurriculum, or more generally, of goals set by the\\nteacher, by the educational system, end by the\\nrequirements of the world beyond the school.\\nWhat children know is what they can show they\\nknow.

Success-\\nful pupils come to understand the criteria of what\\nis important, how to distinguish the signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant\\nthings from the trivinl, and how to tell the tencher\\nwhat she wants to know. Each new communica-\\ntion is predicated upon this accumulating context\\nof common knowledge (Edwards 54 Mercer, 1986;\\n1987). Collective remembering, then, whatever its\\nnature Imd chuuteristics, is a basic constituent of\\nteaching and leuning in the classroom\\xe2\\x80\\x98 Examined\\nhere are some of its characteristics in some trul-\\nscrihed video\\xe2\\x80\\x94recorded lessons, taken from the\\nlarger study of the development of shared\\nknowledge in schools.\\n\\nFirst, some brief de\\xef\\xac\\x81nitions: The term\\n\"context\" will be used to refer to everything that\\nthe participate in l conversation know and under-\\n\\nstand over uzd above that which in explicit in\\nwhat they say, that contributes to how they make\\nsense of what is said. \"Continuity\" is the develop-\\nment of such context: through time. The notion\\nhens comparison to George Herbert Mend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \"emer-\\ngent present,\" which is usefully summarized by\\nGri\\xef\\xac\\x82in end Mehun (1981) as follows: \"that which\\nis going on in the present inexorably becomes the\\npast, informing md reforming the present, while\\nfuture events inform the sense of the present\" (p.\\n190).\\n\\nIt is a commonplace observation in studies of\\nlanguage and communication that meeugee\\ndepend for their meanings on the contexts in which\\nthey take place. These contexts are of various\\nsorts, A \\xef\\xac\\x81rst distinction may be drawn between\\nlinguistic And non-linguietic contexts; the linguistic\\ncontext is the speech or text that precedes and fol-\\nlows any given utterance, while the non-linguintic\\ncontext includes the time end place, the social\\noccasion, the persons involved, their behuviour and\\ngestures, and so on. Bath sorts of context are very\\nrelevant to the form or structure of any discourse,\\nand Ilsa to its content. Sequence 1 illustrates some\\nimportant points.

It is necessary for us to\\nknow About vuious physical activities, gestures\\nand props in order to make vmper sense of the\\ndialogue, and of course the same is true [or the\\nparticipants. There are the usual textual markers\\nof context dependent diecourw-pmnouns Iehe, itI\\nyou), locatives (up there, down here), ellipsis\\n(incomplete sentences, etc), the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nite article\\n(the), and so on. But two rather less obvious\\nfeatures of this context dependence are equally\\nimportant. These are (1) the fact that all of the\\ndialogue cu: be said to be dependent on context\\nfor its meaning, and (2) the {Mt that the context is\\n\\nnot physical but mental. These will be explored in\\nturn.\\n\\nThe dependence of all of the dialogue on a\\ncurrent, previously estnblished, or implicit context\\nis seen clearly as we examine particular words.\\n\"Pendulum,\" for example, has a general,\\nabstracted de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition such as this one from the\\nOxford English dictionary-J\\xe2\\x80\\x98suspended body\\nswinging to and fro by force of gravity...\" ln\\nSequence 1 it also has a much more speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c\\nmeaningnie, its situational reference to the pa:-\\nticulu wooden structure am the pupils hm in\\nfront of them. Similarly, the words \"height,\"\\n\"ground,\" \"table,\" \"muk\" (and m on) all have\\nparticular situated referents, in addition, these\\nparticular meanings are ones thut the participants\\nin the dialogue understand jointly. Each person\\nhas to understand what the other meanst For\\nexample, David \\xef\\xac\\x81rst uses the word \"ground,\" then\\nadjusts this to \"table,\" this being ell\\'ectively the\\nground on which the pendulum studs, rather\\nthan, say, the \\xef\\xac\\x82oor of the classroomv Hie gestures\\nmake clear what he means, The teacher then uses\\nthe word \"ground,\" relying on the fact that David\\nhad already made clesr whet it refers to. Another\\nexample is the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of the word \"even,\"\\nnear the end of the extract. It seems to mean\\nsomething close to \"eqnidiatuit,\" eince she points\\nsimultaneously to three point: a certain distance\\n\\nApart on the wooden structure, and makes it a\\nmajor theme of the lesson that scienti\\xef\\xac\\x81c measure\\nments have to be accurate and consistent in scale.\\nIn order for teacher and pupils to understand etch\\nother and develop I shared conception of the work\\nthey ue doing on pendulums, it is crucially impor-\\ntant that they are able to relate discourse to con-\\ntext, and build through time a joint frame of refer-\\nence\\n\\nThe notion that context is not physical but\\nmental is an essential part of the linlt between\\ndiscourse and knowledge. We normally think of\\nthe \"context\" of an utterance as something con-\\ncrete end deteminahlenthe surrounding tdk or\\ntext, the surrounding actions, gestures and situnv\\ntiont But this is an outsider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view. For the parti-\\ncipuits, the context of any utterance is more a\\nmatter of perception and memorynwhat they think\\nhas been said, what they think was meant, what\\nthey perceive to be relevant. For example, as I\\nwrite these words, I am seated at a ward\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nproceeeing microcomputer, surrounded by book:\\nuid papers, a desk, walls painted a particular\\ncolour, and so on It is a university academic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nof\\xef\\xac\\x81ce You the reader will be situated in a physi-\\ncal context also. maybe even a similar one to mine\\nThe point is thet none of this was contextual to\\nwhat I em writing until the point at which I men-\\ntioned it. The physical circumstances of my act of\\ncommunication, whether spoken or written, could\\nsupport an in\\xef\\xac\\x81nity of detailed descriptions. What\\nmntters is what the participants in the communi-\\ncation undenthnd and see as relevant. Even the\\nsurrounding discourse itself is contextual only in so\\nfar as it is remembered or understood, whether\\nucurutely or not.\\n\\nAll of the dialogue proceeds against this sort\\nof cumulative shued mental context, The impli-\\ncations for our understanding of \"education\" are\\nprofound. We can say that the process of educa-\\ntion, in so far as it succeeds, is largely the esth\\nlishment of these shued mental \"contexts,\" joint\\nunderstandings between teacher and children,\\nwhich enable them to engage together in educa-\\ntional discourse. Teuhers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 words serve to\\nhighlight the signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant aspects of the leewn\\xe2\\x80\\x99e\\nutivity.

Here we have Jonathan\\xe2\\x80\\x98s\\nveraion.\\n\\nJonathan and his partner Lucy had been\\nusigned the task of varying the pendulum bob\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nweight, and measuring the e\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'ect this had on its\\nperiod of swing (i.e., the time taken to swing to\\nand Ira). This variation of weight should have no\\neffect on period of swing, and after some negotia-\\ntion with the teacher in Lesson 1\\xe2\\x80\\x98 this was agreed\\nto be the \\xef\\xac\\x81nding. The most notebIe reconstruction\\nin Sequence 6 i: Jonathan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s declaration th-t he\\nand his partner had varied weight altime1 that they\\nchanged the number of washers \"and did them at\\n\\nthe same height (i.e., angle) each time.\" In fut,\\nJonathan and Lucy actually altered angle as well\\nas weight, a fact that the teneher at that time\\nchose consistently to ignore, and it was never esta\\xc2\\xbb\\nblished whether or not they had used the proper\\ncontrols when altering the two variables. By the\\ntime we came to Lesson 2, the importance of alter\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ning vuiables one at a time had been grasped, and\\npupils end teacher were prepared to collude in a\\nblatant revision of what had actually occurred.\\nSimilarly, Jonathan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s con\\xef\\xac\\x81rmatory response to the\\nsuggestion that the results surprised him was a\\ndirect contradiction of his declaration in Lesson 1\\nthat the results were just as he had predicted.\\nIndeed, he goes on in Lesson 2, shortly after this\\nsequence, to Articulate the reconstructed\\nhypothesis: \"I thought it might go faster because\\nit has a different weight.\" Whatever the truth of\\nthe matter, the experimental \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings have now\\nbecome jointly understood as results that\\ndiscontinued a hypothesis. Perhaps Jonathan was\\noriginally unwilling to admit to what may have\\nseemed at the time an error of judgment, that he\\nhad made a false prediction. In any event, by Lee\\nson 2 he has chosen to con\\xef\\xac\\x81rm the teuher\\xe2\\x80\\x99a\\nprompted question (\"which surprised you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nit\\'i\"), that the results were unexpected. Certainly.\\nit is far more Meeptable to have one\\xe2\\x80\\x98s hypothesis\\nscienti\\xef\\xac\\x81cally discontinued than simply to have\\nmade an error o(judgment\\n\\nAnother notable piece of reconstructive re-\\ncapping occurred in Lesson 2 when teacher and\\npupils were mailing the experiment done by\\nSharon and Karen, that varied angle of swing. It\\nwould appear from Sequence 7 (opposite page)\\nthat Sharon and Karen chose angles that were\\nequal distance: apart, 15 degrees, as a matter of\\nproper scienti\\xef\\xac\\x81c procedure. But as Sequence 3\\n(next page, from Lesson 1) demonstrates quite\\nclearly, the four angles were \\xef\\xac\\x81mt marked without\\nmeasurement on the top of the pendulum, and\\nthen, only after the experiment was completed,\\nwere they estimated, under the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x98s guidurce,\\nto be equidistant 1t intervals of 15 degrees.\\nSharon and Kuen had in feet determined their\\nvarious angles of swing earlier in the lesson by\\nuncalibrated trial and error. constrained not by\\nany principle of scienti\\xef\\xac\\x81c measurement, but by the\\nmgla at which the string was found to snag on\\nthe pendulum upright,\\n\\nThe Eeeylnlv Nmrleuu lfth Loilrllny .1 Cumulative Human Cnniliom Jlnllu\\'y 1987\\xe2\\x80\\x98 Volume 9.

The way in which the interv-le\\nwere actually arrived at was never I\\xef\\xac\\x82iculated. We\\nare forced to the conclusion that it would clearly\\nbe inadvisable to place too much emphasis on the\\nimportnnee of what pupils leun simply from their\\nown activity and experience, even when working\\nwith practical equipment, making empiricul obeeb\\nvltione. What really matters is the interpretation\\nput upon that experience, the words which de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne\\nand communicate it, the principles encapsulated in\\nthe words, and the re-working of events that those\\nwords emy, And it is largely the teacher who\\nprovides those words while eliminating others from\\nthe common vocabulary, governing the discursive\\nprocess in which particular descriptions and ver-\\nsions of events are eetehlished as the basis of joint\\nunderstanding.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe notion of memory or remembering u the\\nrate lemming of materials has little relevance to\\nmodern educational practice. But the notion af e\\ndeveloping consensus of ehued knowledge ie much\\nmore interesting. The idea that education involves\\nthe workings of collective memory has two comple-\\nmentary foundations. One is that educational\\nknowledge has the properties of u ready\\xe2\\x80\\x94mnde cul-\\nture that precedes the coming together of teacher\\nand pupae The other is the process of collective\\nremembering, the building of a context end eon-\\ntinuity of shared knowledge as the utivity and\\ndiscourse of each lesson proceed. In developing a\\nehued vocabulary for experience end understand-\\ning. and u. jointly held version of events in the\\nclassroom, teacher and pupils construct a frame-\\nwork of educational knowledge which re\\xef\\xac\\x82ects both\\nsides of the process, ie., pupile\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experiences in the\\nclassroom, and the principle: and categories of\\nunderstanding that the curriculum, or the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x98s\\nprecanceptions, have set as the egende to be\\nlearned.\\n\\nBut the process of construction is not one\\nthet occurs between equll partners.

It is not that teaching has to be\\nulthorituiun. It is merely that looking at educa-\\ntion in terms of collective remembering forces us to\\nrecognise the importance of culture as being, us far\\nas school children Are concerned, Lugely ready\\xc2\\xbb\\nmade, us is the mturul language they will already\\nhave lemed. And he with natural language, the\\nexpertise that children need to acquire is one of\\ncompetence end creativity, of having acquired the\\nsystem and its rules of operation, and of being able\\nto move freely within it. In the older, traditional\\npedagogy, children could pass muster having\\nleuned the trappings of educated thought parrot-\\nfuhion. But that is not how we know language,\\nand it is equally unsuitable as an understanding of\\neducation. But Also inadequate is the more\\nmodern notion of education as elicitationh Children\\ncannot have this cultural knuwledge elicited from\\nthem any more than they can hnve it simply\\ntransmitted to them.

All of the\\ncharacters in the \\xef\\xac\\x81lm were also present in the audi.\\nence except for my grandmother whose 100th\\nbirthday party is included in the \\xef\\xac\\x81lm. Shortly\\nafter New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in 1988. I screened a rough\\nassembly of this material for my parents, my two\\nsisters, their signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant others, one of my two\\nbrothers, and my niece herself, md recorded their\\nverbnl reactions. My motive in making this tape\\nrecording was to give an interutive dimension to\\nwhatever document my material ultimately\\nbecame. I wanted to offset a: much a: possible my\\nprivileged, not to mention voyeuristic, position as\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81lmmaker by letting the \\xef\\xac\\x81lm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjects tellt beck\\nto it. Recalling that audiences customarily talked\\n\\nduring movies in the silent \\xef\\xac\\x81lm en, I hoped to\\nencourage that active, collective dimension of \\xef\\xac\\x81lm\\nviewing on this occasion.\\n\\nWhen I \\xef\\xac\\x81rst began \\xef\\xac\\x81lming, I had I somewhat\\ndi\\xef\\xac\\x82\\'erent project in mind, I wanted to make a\\nfeminist \\xef\\xac\\x81lm that addressed some of the problems\\nand contradictions faced by an independent work-\\ning woman. I wanted this \\xef\\xac\\x81lm to depart stylisti-\\ncally from the usual gloom and doom of socially\\ncritical documentary I Wu especially troubled by\\nthe way certain feminist \\xef\\xac\\x81lm: I had seen, through\\ntheir dreary tone and grainy visuals, seemed to\\nsuggest that women could expect little pleasure\\nfmm their experiences until and unless the world\\nchanged completely. Only then could they expect\\nemotional or social ful\\xef\\xac\\x81llment. My sister o\\xef\\xac\\x82ered\\nme u fascinating counter-example. Rebellious\\nagainst social roles md expectations, she was oth-\\nerwize fnn-loving, generous, and brimming with\\nenergy. If she was not always a conscious feminist,\\nshe nevertheless acted like one. She became the\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81rst woman engineer in west tout network news,\\nand until four months into her pregnancy, she was\\nfrequently on the road as the sound \"man\" in a\\ntwo\\xe2\\x80\\x94person ABC minicun crew. She was not mar-\\nried when she decided to get pregnant. Having\\nbeen mmied twice before, she was not sure that\\nmarriage I: an institution was good for her.\\nFriends and family, myselfincluded, were intensely\\ncurious to see what she would make of motherhood\\nand what motherhood would make of her. I had a\\nfeeling that the outcome would be colorful and\\ndramatic\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\n\\nMy hunch was right. In my shooting 1 try to\\nconvey the creativity, colorfulness, and wumth\\nwith which she continues to lead her life. At the\\nsame time I try not to nndmtete the immense\\ndil\\xef\\xac\\x81cnltie: that the lack of family support services\\nand the rigidity of worklife in our society have put\\nin her way\\xe2\\x80\\x98 My sister has even less time than most\\nparents of infants to nppreciate her daily victories\\nover impossible logistical and economic challenges\\nRecurring crises have not succeeded in lltering her\\npriorities, or her unfailing enthusiasm, but they\\nhave taken their toll on her aelf-image and on her\\nsense of professional direction.\\n\\nDuring the screening, she was surprised nt\\nthe purposefulness and energy at her movements in\\na sequence where she is serubbling down and\\n\\nu n: 0mm\" Nclule\\xef\\xac\\x82n am: Llhnluy o] Cunpul\\xef\\xac\\x82u 3mm 0mm\\xc2\\xbb. .Imlnry 1951, Volume 9, Number 1\\n\\npainting the walls of the new, smaller apartment\\nshe had to move into because she was cunning less\\nmoney and having to pay much of it [at child care.\\n(She thought for a moment that I had shot the\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81lm in fut motion.) Several times she mistook her\\nown image for am of our younger sister,\\napparently unaware of how well she looked during\\nthat di\\xef\\xac\\x81cult time. Perhaps the most curious\\nremark on my tape recording of that \\xef\\xac\\x81rst screening\\nis her enthusiastic proposal that we Atari making a\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81lm or video chronicle of the family My voice on\\nthe tape points out that this is what we have been\\ndoing. One simple explanation for this odd slip is\\nthat Ill her current job doing character generator\\nprogramming, the images she sees on screen am\\nbeing broadcast live. Her desire to have our\\nimages of the family preserved may have indicated\\nno more than that she was usimilating them to\\nthose live images.\\n\\nBut it is tempting to speculate further. I\\nshot and edited the \\xef\\xac\\x81lm more like a documentary\\nthm like a home movie. Itried to elaborate eech\\noccasion so that even someone not there at the\\ntime could get some feel for it. Apparently the\\nstrategy was etfective. At one point, as my\\nbrother and I are driving to my grandmother\\'s\\n100th birthday in the \\xef\\xac\\x81lm, my niece, as spectator,\\nasks, \"Where are we going?\" When it is explained\\nto her that she was not along on this expedition,\\nshe responds suspiciously, \"Is this a movie?\\xe2\\x80\\x9c I\\nthink that my sister, too, was momentarily\\nseduced. She liked what she saw, even though it\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t correspond to what she remembered, and\\nher instinct was to preserve this \"reality,\" too. In\\nother words, the \\xef\\xac\\x81lm itself operated at times, for\\none or mother spectator, like a. primary reality,\\nnot like a reproduction or record of what we all, 01\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\nany one of us, remembered.\\n\\nThe tendency of thin \\xef\\xac\\x81lm, and perhaps 9 cer-\\ntain kind of \"realistic\" \\xef\\xac\\x81lm in general, to usurp, or\\nat least to add onto. the past, is, I think, the issue\\nhere. In the family context this tendency can work\\nadvantageously The \\xef\\xac\\x81lm obviously cil\\'set geo-\\ngraphical distances nmang us, allowing family\\nmembers unable to be present at certain events to\\nform a fairly vivid visual \"memory\" of them. And\\nit offset our temperamental, generational, md pol-\\nitical differences in interesting ways. Each of us\\nwas allowed to be a spectator of the events it dep-\\n\\nicted, freed from our usual roles and\\n\\nresponsibilities as puticiputa in the family\\ndrama. As I compared this experience to the\\ninstances of collective memory described by Dave\\nMiddleton, I began to see a parallell As in the\\ndisuny of the Morris dance, no one pmon at the\\n\\xef\\xac\\x81lm screening was master of the event. Each\\nparticipant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s partial knowledge or spontaneous\\nreaction was equally pertinent. In other words, a\\nspate for improvisation was opened up, the same\\nsort of space opened up by crisis in Middleton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nexamples. This improvisation, in both cues, led\\nto the creation of virtually new meanings or\\n\"memories\" which may actually take the place of,\\nor at least be added onto, other, older patterns,\\npractices, and memories, The danger, obviously, in\\nthat thin medium of collective memory could so\\neasily be abused, as many critics 01\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Hollywood\\nmovies claim it already has been in its\\nindustrially-produced, mass oriented incarnation.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Th: Latin root at this term is COMmeoran: bring to\\nremembrance.

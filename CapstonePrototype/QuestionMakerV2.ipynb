Previous studies\\nfocused on relatively static, enduring features such as gray matter volume and white\\nmatter structure. In this report, we investigate prediction ofintelligence based on\\ntask activation patterns during the N\\xe2\\x80\\x94back working memory task as well as six other\\ntasks in the Human Connectome Project dataset, encompassing 19 task contrasts.\\nWe \\xef\\xac\\x81nd that whole brain task activation patterns are a highly effective basis for\\nprediction ofintelligence, achieving a 0.68 correlation with intelligence scores in an\\nindependent sample, which exceeds results reported from other modalities.\\nAdditionally, we show that tasks that tap executive processing and that are more\\ncognitively demanding are particularly effective for intelligence prediction. These\\nresults suggest a picture analogous to treadmill testing for cardiac function: Placing\\nthe brain in an activated task state improves brain\\xe2\\x80\\x94based prediction ofintelligence.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nIn addition to particular abilities associated with individual cognitive tasks, there is\\nsubstantial evidence for an overarching general ability involved in performance\\nacross a diverse range oftasksk5 Intelligence tests composed of multiple subtests\\ncan yield accurate estimates of this general ability, usually denoted g, and which we\\nhere refer to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligence\".l\\xe2\\x80\\x9d:7 Intelligence is a fundamental dimension of\\nindividual differences and is a key contributor to a number ofimportant academic,\\noccupational, health, and well\\xe2\\x80\\x94being\\xe2\\x80\\x94related outcomes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9c13 There is thus substantial\\ninterest in understanding the neural basis ofintelligence and in developing\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cneuromarkers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ofintelligence, objective brain\\xe2\\x80\\x94based means of measuring\\nindividual differences.\\n\\nOne potentially promising route is to construct neuromarkers of intelligence from\\nneuroimaging maps, including structural and functional imaging.

An alternative approach for\\nconstructing neuromarkers ofintelligence, whose rationale resembles that for\\ncardiac treadmill testing. attempts to \\xef\\xac\\x81rst place the brain in an activated state that\\nengages these cognitive abilities, rendering brain features associated with these\\nabilities more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvisible\" to functional imaging [see 25 for a suggestion along these\\nlines].\\n\\nInterestingly, while task\\xe2\\x80\\x94based neuroimaging studies have been extensively used to\\ninvestigate the brain\\xe2\\x80\\x94basis ofintelligence, they have thus far been used nearly\\nexclusively for the purposes oflocalization: Activation patterns in higher versus\\nlower intelligence individuals are compared to identify the places in the brain where\\nthere are statistically signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant differences.z\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9d3\\xe2\\x80\\x983 Task\\xe2\\x80\\x94based studies have thus far\\nnot been used widely in a prediction framework in which whole\\xe2\\x80\\x94brain activation\\npatterns are harnessed for making predictions ofeach subject\\'s intelligence.\\n\\nIn the current study, we address this notable gap. Utilizing the Human Connectome\\nProject\\'s 1200 release, we construct a highly reliable measure ofintelligence from\\n10 measures from the NIH Toolbox and Penn Neurocognitive Battery. We then\\nexamine brain\\xe2\\x80\\x94based prediction ofintelligence from contrast maps derived from the\\n2\\xe2\\x80\\x94back working memory task as well as six other fMRI tasks [19 task contrasts in\\ntotal], and we establish two things. First, task\\xe2\\x80\\x94based activation patterns allow highly\\nreliable prediction ofintelligence, with performance appreciably higher than that\\nreported in other neuroimaging modalities. Second, tasks that tap executive\\nprocessing and that are more cognitively demanding yield more accurate\\npredictions of intelligence.\\n\\n2 Methods\\n\\n2.1 Subjects and Data Acquisition\\n\\nAll subjects and data were from the HCP\\xe2\\x80\\x941200 release31:3Z and all research was\\nperformed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

A full list of \\xef\\xac\\x81lenames ofthe contrast maps used can be found\\nin the Supplemental Table 81.\\n\\n2.4 Constructing a General Intelligence Factor\\n\\nWe conducted an exploratory factor analysis utilizing the strategy and associated\\ncode supplied by Dubois and colleagues [https://github.com/adolphslab/HCP_MRI\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nbehavior], who recently investigated prediction of intelligence from resting state\\nMRI in the HCP dataset35. Unadjusted scores from ten cognitive tasks for 1181 HCP\\nsubjects were included in the analysis [subjects with missing data or MMSE < 26\\nwere excluded], including seven tasks from the NIH Toolbox [Dimensional Change\\nCart Sort, Flanker Task, List Sort Test, Picture Sequence Test, Picture Vocabulary\\nTest, Pattern Completion Test, Oral Reading Recognition Test] and three tasks from\\nthe Penn Neurocognitive Battery [Penn Progressive Matrices, Penn Word Memory\\nTest, Variable Short Penn Line Orientation Test], with additional details supplied\\nin\\xe2\\x80\\x9c.\\n\\nWe applied Dubois and colleagues\\' code to this data, which in turn uses the omega\\nfunction in the psych [v 1.8.4] package37 in R [v3.4.4]. In particular, the code\\nperforms maximum likelihood\\xe2\\x80\\x94estimated exploratory factor analysis [specifying a\\nbifactor model], oblimin factor rotation, followed by a Schmid\\xe2\\x80\\x94Leiman\\ntransformation3E to \\xef\\xac\\x81nd general factor loadings.\\n\\nTo assess reliability, in a separate analysis, we re\\xe2\\x80\\x94ran the factor analysis excluding\\n46 subjects that had Test/Retest sessions available. We then estimated factor scores\\nfor both sessions for these subjects and calculated test/retest reliability via\\nintraclass correlation [we used ICC[2,1] in the Shrout and Fleiss scheme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n2.5 Train/Test Split\\n\\nThe 958 subjects after exclusions were divided into two groups. To generate a test\\ndataset of 100 unrelated subjects we first selected the 86 subjects with no siblings\\nwho passed exclusion criteria. Then, we randomly selected 14 families from those\\nfamilies with 2 siblings included and randomly dropped one sibling ofeach pair.\\nThis resulted in 944 total subjects for our analyses, with 844 in the training data and\\n100 unrelated subjects in the test set.\\n\\n2.6 Dimensionality Estimation and Principal Component Analysis\\n\\nIn the training dataset, each subject\\'s unthresholded task data from 19 task\\ncontrasts was vectorized and concatenated yielding 19 matrices, each with\\ndimensions of 844 subjects by 91282 grayordinates. We next estimated the number\\nof intrinsic dimensions associated with each task contrast. This was accomplished\\nby submitting each of the 19 subjects x grayordinates contrast matrices to the\\ndimensionality estimation procedure of Levina and Bickel\\xe2\\x80\\x98m.

To accomplish this, we\\nused Brain Basis Set [BBS] modeling. previously described in detail\\xe2\\x80\\x9c.\\n\\nIn a training dataset, we calculate the expression scores for each of the n\\ncomponents for each subject by projecting their data onto the 7S principal\\ncomponents. We then \\xef\\xac\\x81t a linear regression model with these expression scores as\\npredictors and the phenotype ofinterest [i.e., intelligence] as the outcome, saving B,\\nthe n X 1 vector of fitted coefficients, for later use. In a test dataset, we again\\ncalculate the expression scores for each of the n components for each subject. Our\\npredicted phenotype for each test subject is the dot product ofB learned from the\\ntraining dataset with the vector of component expression scores for that subject.\\nWe assessed performance of BBS\\xe2\\x80\\x94based prediction ofintelligence by calculating the\\ncorrelation between predicted versus actual intelligence in the test sample.\\n\\n2.8 Addressing Additional Potential Confounds\\n\\nIn an additional analysis, we used multiple regression to remove a number of\\npotential confounds from the intelligence variable [i.e.,g]. Similar to Dubois et al.35,\\nvariables regressed were: age, handedness, gender, brain size, multiband\\nreconstruction algorithm version number [HCP variables: Age_In_Yrs, Handedness,\\nGender, FS_BrainSeg_Vol, fMRI_3T_ReconVrs], and mean framewise displacement\\n[task\\xe2\\x80\\x94specific values were used]. Analyses involving intelligence prediction were\\nthen repeated with the confound\\xe2\\x80\\x94cleansed variable. Results were broadly similar to\\nthe original analyses and are presented in Supplemental Table 82.\\n\\n2.9 Consensus Component Maps for Visualization\\n\\nWe used BBS with 75 whole\\xe2\\x80\\x94brain components to make predictions about\\nintelligence. To help convey overall patterns across the entire BBS predictive model,\\nwe constructed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsensus\" component maps.

All\\n75 components as well as consensus component maps for each of the 19 task\\ncontrasts have been shared on BALSA, the Human Connectome Projects\\' website for\\nsharing and hosting neuroimaging datasets and can be accessed here:\\nhttps://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/MZPV.\\n\\n4 Discussion\\n\\nThis study is the first to systematically assess neuroimaging\\xe2\\x80\\x94based prediction of\\nintelligence across multiple fMRI task conditions. We find that whole\\xe2\\x80\\x94brain task\\nactivation patterns are a highly effective basis for prediction ofintelligence, with a\\nmodel trained on activation during the N\\xe2\\x80\\x94back working memory task achieving a\\n0.68 correlation with intelligence scores in an independent sample. Additionally, we\\ndemonstrate that more cognitively demanding tasks are particularly effective for\\nintelligence prediction. These results highlight the importance of placing the brain\\nin an activated task state for accurate brain\\xe2\\x80\\x94based prediction ofintelligence.\\n\\nRole ofexecutive regions in prediction ofintelligence\\n\\nThe importance of fronto\\xe2\\x80\\x94parietal network, as well as related executive regions [e.g.,\\ndorsal anterior cingulate], for intelligence has been highlighted in previous work,\\nespecially in lung and Haier\\'s in\\xef\\xac\\x82uential fronto\\xe2\\x80\\x94parietal integration theory\\xe2\\x80\\x9c. In a\\nsimilar vein, Duncan and colleagues proposed that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmultiple demand\" cortexi\\nregions ofthe brain that activate across a broad range of cognitively demanding\\ntasks457are a primary substrate ofintelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The present study extends these\\nfindings by demonstrating a key role for fronto\\xe2\\x80\\x94parietal regions as a major source of\\ndiscriminative information for making subject\\xe2\\x80\\x94level predictions of intelligence. This\\nadditional role of executive regions was supported in three complementary ways.\\n\\nFirst, in looking across the set of 19 contrasts derived from seven HCP tasks, we\\nfound that tasks that tap executive processes were more predictive ofintelligence\\n[e.g., N\\xe2\\x80\\x94back task contrasts, relational reasoning task contrasts, and math vs. story\\ncontrast]. Second, we found that FPN activation and DMN deactivation, highly\\nassociated with the cognitive demandingness of task conditions45\\xe2\\x80\\x9952, predict which\\ntask contrasts will be effective for intelligence prediction. Third, within highly\\npredictive contrasts, such the 2\\xe2\\x80\\x94back vs. 0\\xe2\\x80\\x94back contrast and math vs. story contrast,\\nactivation patterns in executive regions were prominent among regions predictive\\nof intelligence.\\n\\n10\\n\\nbioRxw preprim first posted online Sep. 9, 2018: doi hnp://dx.doi org/1O 1 101/412056. The copyright noider lor this preprint\\n(which was no! peerrreviewed) is the author/funder. who has granted bioleiv a license to dispiay the preprim in perpetuity\\nn is made avaiiable under a cosy 4.0 international iicense\\n\\nInterestingly, for certain regions, the directionality of prediction of intelligence\\nexhibited some variability across task contrasts in a way suggestive of moderation\\nby task difficulty [for example, see pre\\xe2\\x80\\x94SMA in 0\\xe2\\x80\\x94back compared to 2\\xe2\\x80\\x94back and in\\nmatch compared to relational]. These observations are consistent with a neural\\nef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency model of intelligence proposed by Neubauer and Pink\\xe2\\x80\\x9c. They propose\\nthat higher intelligence is associated with greater processing efficiency in\\nelementary cognitive tasks [leading to less activation in more intelligent\\nindividuals] but greater processing capacity in demanding cognitive tasks [leading\\nto greater activation in more intelligent people], thus potentially explaining the\\n\\xef\\xac\\x82ipped directions of activation observed across the easy and hard conditions ofthe\\nN\\xe2\\x80\\x94back and other tasks.\\n\\nWhile activation patterns in executive regions clearly play an important role in\\nexplaining the success of our task\\xe2\\x80\\x94based approach to intelligence prediction, there is\\nstill clear evidence for substantial discriminative information about intelligence\\nlocated outside executive regions. This is apparent in looking at the consensus\\ncomponent images in Figure 3 as well Figure 81 in the Supplement. Activations are\\nobserved in distributed regions of cortex, including non\\xe2\\x80\\x94executive regions such as\\nvisual cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and temporal pole, among other regions.\\n\\nComparison ofmsk-based prediction with other modalities\\n\\nPrevious studies using neuroimaging for prediction of intelligence have primarily\\nused structural measures, for example cortical thickness15115 or white matter\\nstructure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, for reviews see 21\\xe2\\x80\\x9923. In terms offunctional fMRI, recent studies have\\nexamined resting state connectivity patterns.1E\\xe2\\x80\\x99Z\\xe2\\x80\\x98J In an important study by Dubois\\nand colleagues\\xe2\\x80\\x9c that examined the same HCP 1200 dataset used in the present\\nstudy, they found resting state connectivity patterns predicted intelligence with a\\ncorrelation of0.44 in cross\\xe2\\x80\\x94validated testing [see also a related \\xef\\xac\\x81nding from our\\ngroup\\xe2\\x80\\x9c). While impressive, this is still substantially less than the peak correlation of\\n0.68 achieved in the present study in out\\xe2\\x80\\x94of\\xe2\\x80\\x94sample testing.\\n\\nThere are two interrelated reasons why task\\xe2\\x80\\x94based fMRI might potentially offer\\nmore reliable prediction of intelligence than other modalities. The first appeals to\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreadmill testing\" idea already mentioned: actively34 engaging in cognitive tasks\\nhas the potential to unmask critical intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x94relevant features of the brain that\\nare otherwise invisible in other modalities such as structural brain imaging. A\\nsecond potential advantage of task\\xe2\\x80\\x94based methods is speci\\xef\\xac\\x81city. Tasks are\\nconstructed by their designers to target specific psychological processes, often with\\ncontrol conditions that subtract away contributions from auxiliary processes of no\\ninterest. This will tend to make classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation more accurate as the feature set is\\nculled ofa sizable number of uninformative features.\\n\\nFuture Directions\\n\\nResults from this study open the door to promising additional lines of research. It is\\nnotable thatwe used the set of imaging tasks that were included in the HCP dataset.\\nThese imaging tasks, in turn, were selected based on diverse considerations [see 34],\\n\\n11\\n\\nbIoRxw preprim first posted online Sep. 9. 2018: doi http://dx.dol org/1O \\xe2\\x80\\x9c01/412056.
